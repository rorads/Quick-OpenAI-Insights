## Step 1: Setting up an OpenAI API Key

[x] The first Step is to sign up for an OpenAI account and get an API key. The OpenAI API provides a variety of NLP services that can be used to analyze text data. In this case, we will be using the OpenAI GPT-3 API for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and topic clustering. Once you have your API key, you can proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Prepare the Text Data

[x] Before we can start analyzing the text data, we need to preprocess it to make it suitable for analysis.
