0:00
so I think we are fine to get started and the first thing on the agenda
0:05
is oh
0:13
the first thing on our agenda is a message from Dr Philip ormondsey
0:19
oh I should have used this slide I'm just realizing that sorry I hear that thing I've said all of that
0:25
all right thanks yeah thank you very much and thank you for hosting this Market engagement event
0:31
uh welcome everyone uh to this event we're really delighted to have you here it's great to see that CCS Crown
0:39
commercial service and hmrc a collaborating on such an important
0:44
um activity not just for hmrc but for the oil of government um Legacy migration Legacy encapsulation
0:52
Legacy remediation is quite topical right now most of um what we spend in government you know
0:59
goes to where is managing our Legacy estate so it's really good to see us working collaboratively with hmrc to
1:06
launch this this framework um ccs and Andrew tomasi through the
1:13
creation of our Dallas agreement supports the public sector strategic approach to migrating from Legacy
1:20
applications and we're hoping that our partners will support us again in this
1:25
in this in this venture to ensure that we do this right but do it um at a cost
1:32
um effective and valid delivery
1:37
process Dallas will offer an easy approach to assist in the provision of
1:44
more cost effective and innovative solutions um again not just for HMR see but for
1:49
the oil of government so my team and the team at the hmrc are looking forward to hearing from you all on this approach
1:56
and on how we can ensure the success of yet another CCS agreement
2:01
um please um listening to the conversations that our teams are going to be having with you this morning and uh continue the
2:08
dialogue and the engagement and um I wish I wish you know all participants in this engagement are very
2:16
successful event thank you very much for attending and hopefully um hope to see or speak or interact with
2:23
you all pretty soon thank you
2:35
right thank you Philip and well thanks to everybody for coming uh I'd like to
2:41
make a welcome from hmrc to everybody both in the room and online it's still a
2:47
still a bit of a novelty as they're seeing everybody back face to face and it is uh it's absolutely great to see so thank you very much for that and I'm
2:53
going to give an introduction uh to why why we're doing this why is hmrc with
2:59
our friends in CTS building this framework and what's the purpose so this is really the vehicle for the
3:07
next stage in the technology sourcing program tsp hopefully most of you in the room will have heard of tsp we'll have a
3:14
knowledge of of tsp but what effectively tsp is is bringing the brain back in to
3:21
hmrc we've been outsourced for a long long time and a lot of the knowledge has
3:26
sat with third-party suppliers tsp is all about bringing the brain back in and
3:33
so far what have we done we've done the disaggregation of the contracts but that's very much the start of tsp it is
3:40
not what tsp is about so the disaggregation so far has been taking those big monolithic outsourced
3:47
contracts and breaking them up into smaller contracts but what we've done is
3:52
we've taken one of Monopoly contracts easy for me to say and we've broken them down into much
3:58
smaller Monopoly contracts and we've done that for a couple of reasons the mature of hmrc didn't enable us to go
4:07
from where we were to where we want to be in one jump and also we had time constraints to get us to where we needed
4:14
to be so Dallas is going to provide us that next level of contract vehicle to get
4:21
the maturity of hmrc to help build that intelligent client to help us take the
4:27
applications and our services to the next level so there's three main aims of
4:33
Dallas they all begin with C which makes it nice and easy to remember capability its capacity and its
4:40
competition what Dallas aims to do is down select a smaller group of suppliers who will have
4:47
the confidence that they are going to get significant work from hmrc so they
4:54
are able to invest in hmrc really getting to know hmrc and provide the
5:01
best quality of service to hmrc having multiple providers though gives
5:08
us the best capacity I don't think I've ever known such squeeze on capacity as
5:15
we have right now so relying on two smaller number of suppliers puts it at risk and I think we've just seen across
5:23
lots of areas over the last 12 24 months how important diversity in the supply
5:28
chain is and this will help us with that as well and then finally competition
5:34
small number of suppliers that are pre-down selected means that we can keep competition helps Drive value for money
5:41
or we can also do it quicker so instead of having to run procurements it takes months through the Dallas framework we
5:47
should be able to turn things around in a matter of weeks so they're the three main drivers you'll get some more detail
5:53
today and this is the first of of a whole string of of Market engagement so
5:59
we really do want to hear your thoughts as well at the end of it we've got some questions um but we also have follow-up sessions
6:06
so I'm now going to hand over to Mike
6:12
thank you Lee good morning all uh my name is Mike Hannan um I'm the category lead within CCS for
6:19
technology Services cyber and Technology transport and our my team will be
6:25
looking after the Dallas framework and making sure that goes live yeah and we're really pleased to be
6:30
working with hmrc as Philip said to get this off the road because we think it's a good good idea a good way of bringing
6:37
in and changing the way the the Legacy services are developed and maintained
6:43
okay just uh Sean to the next slide so this is what we think the the lighting structure looks like we're pretty sure
6:49
this is about how we're going to look forward against a little bit more detail of the lot names and what goes through
6:55
and and Phil we'll go through more of those in the level of detail why they're there for supported hmrc
7:02
and clearly this is we've been talking to other government departments as well and they are looking to do something
7:08
very similar to this so we're trying to build this so it's a capability that's available for all uh government
7:15
departments okay so um as as Lee said we're trying
7:20
to look at the rationalize the number of suppliers across each of the lots to ensure that we got the the right
7:25
suppliers in there the right competition the right capabilities um to align those so you know we will go
7:31
into further detail around that um ecosystem it this more or less aligns
7:36
to what are the type of suppliers we're looking for within those areas and and Phil again we'll go into more detail
7:42
around what they look like and why we've got them there we just flip onto the next slide so
7:49
um I'm not going to go through all the level of details within there's a lot of detail on there but but effectively this
7:54
is a design service aspect for lot one um we're looking at the support and the
8:00
delivery aspects for that design design activity okay until
8:06
okay and this is the larger scale integration and development services so we're looking for large-scale
8:12
organizations to support this these were very larger values across the the programs of activity hmrc will be
8:20
putting out and we move on to 2B and these are the for the smaller SME level suppliers
8:27
with this lower level lower value but you know still great capability that need to support hmrc and other Supply
8:34
and other customers on okay lot three is integration and run
8:40
Services um you know there's nothing new there the these These are still required
8:46
um again large-scale suppliers they are big platforms big activities they're going through that will need supporting
8:54
um configuration Services again lot 4A is the larger scale Prime aspects with
9:02
um ecosystems of suppliers supporting this uh this service again lots of the
9:08
the normal activities that you'd expect within the configuration service and and until up 4B and 4B we talk about the The
9:16
Specialist so we're back into an SME environment of how that and what that helps deliver
9:22
in smaller programs smaller projects activities and again it would all be
9:28
aligned through as one one activity for for hmrc so they can manage all of the
9:34
supply base and we look at the other customers are looking for that as well yeah if we move on to five and this is a
9:42
capability pipeline for Academy um trading as Lee said you've lost lost
9:49
knowledge lost a capabilities within the organization and this is then building up and putting back in that knowledge
9:57
within hmrc and we know this from lots of other government partners that are this is also required it's something
10:04
that is missing and they want to bring back from all their years of Outsourcing
10:11
um I'm going to head over to Phil now to just go into what the next aspects looks like in
10:17
terms of what they think the value is going through the the framework at this level for hmrc
10:28
good morning I'm Phil desbrie associate director for it commercial my particular focus is as the commercial lead for hmrc
10:36
for the Dallas project delivering that alongside our colleagues in CCS if we
10:42
can move on to the next slide you'll see an expanded view here of the last instructor that Mike's already shown you
10:48
so just to explain this in a bit more detail so when we were conceptualizing this model
10:55
we started to look at some of the challenges and problems that hmrc faced
11:01
so in the digital space for example digital development we had a situation
11:06
where we had a very small number of suppliers who had to be assigned to do one particular piece of activity so we
11:11
didn't have ongoing competitive tension and we struggled to adopt the GDs
11:18
approach to Rainbow teams where you would have individuals from multiple suppliers working together to
11:24
deliver the same types of things and when we have been able to do that with an hmrc what that's tended to mean
11:31
is that you've had a hmrc person looking after that rainbow team and therefore the risk for delivery all stays with
11:38
hmrc rather than being transferred into the market so we started off with that
11:44
as a strategic problem and then started to build around this as to what the loss instructor should look like so as Mike's
11:50
already pointed out we have some large-scale suppliers operating in the digital space today
11:55
what we want to do is bolster that capability by bringing in opportunities for smaller suppliers smes of course but
12:02
we're not being restrictive about that and in lap 2A and 2B one of the restrictions we are going to make is
12:08
that if for the suppliers that bid they cannot be on both Lots so that will give us the opportunity to
12:15
have a nice mix of both larger suppliers and smaller suppliers lot 3 which will also be delivered as
12:22
part of the first wave of competition activity as Mike said is largely based
12:27
on the Legacy run services that exist today so you will you will already know from TSP we've competed things like
12:34
corporation tax we've competed things like child Benefit services and real-time information
12:40
those services are going to be ultimately within that lot but you'll also see services that currently exist
12:46
in borders and trade in that lot the services that we have retained with
12:51
some incumbent suppliers that cover things like self-assessment that cover paye that cover banking services over
12:58
time they will start to exit those contracts and will also drop into this framework as a means of procuring those
13:05
services and when you think about the number of suppliers that we've we've um put here
13:11
as our aspiration that's very much focused on the point that Lee made about very rapid
13:17
competition so what you can expect to see as we go through this process and we'll describe
13:22
it in a bit more detail later in the presentation is to take steps to robustly pre-qualify the suppliers that
13:29
we appoint on the basis of their capacity their capability their ability to work together with other suppliers
13:36
and the reason we need that is because when we have a trusted supplier group we are then able to share much more
13:42
information with that trusted supplier group with the best will in the world and for all of the wonderful things that CCS has
13:48
done with their Frameworks it's impossible for us to be able to share the level of information that we have
13:53
with 150 suppliers on tech services three or three thousand suppliers on dos if we have a smaller group of suppliers
14:01
we can be much more open about our pipelines we could be much more open about our architecture about our
14:06
Journeys about what's happening a year in advance when the plans crystallize what's happening three months in advance
14:11
and that information sharing will enable suppliers to be better placed to respond
14:17
toward a rapid competition approach so we're anticipating that once this lands we'll be able in a lot of cases
14:22
particularly in Lots two and four to turn competitions around and around about four to six weeks so it's quite a
14:29
move from where we are now where we average about 14 weeks for a Dos competition in about five months for a
14:35
competition through tech services three so quite a difference to what we see today
14:41
so those suppliers you'll see from the the screen will be required in some cases to have an SME ecosystem with them
14:48
so that will be in the lot where we are not specifically targeting smes so in
14:54
Lots 2B and 4B we're giving smes the opportunities to bid there and to try to remove the
14:59
barriers to entry and as a consequence of that they won't be required to bring an SME ecosystem with them because
15:04
that's quite an overhead for an SME anyway to front that for other smes in the lots that
15:11
aren't specifically targeted at smes there will be some requirements there but we're going to make some changes to
15:17
what was done within tsp so in tsp we had a requirement of a pass-through of
15:23
at least 30 percent of revenues to an ecosystem of at least five suppliers in most of the cases what we're going to do
15:30
in Dallas because we've got the equator SME consideration with those lots is reduce the revenue pass through to 20 to
15:37
a minimum of three smes so that's perhaps a little bit more different and a little bit more attractive perhaps to
15:42
some of the bidders the annual values that you see quoted that's a forecast value roughly based on
15:49
our spend today so it's not a Target and it's not a commitment as such so we just need to position that correctly but
15:56
that's what we anticipate spending each year over the course of the framework and the total value we've calculated
16:02
over five years because as with all Frameworks there are certain contracts that you can let up to seven years be on
16:08
the expiry of the framework so we're anticipating from a total value point of view that hmrcs spend alone will be in
16:15
the order of about two billion pounds over the next five years now huge numbers as you can imagine and
16:21
as Lee said huge pie to be able to go around a number of suppliers that will exist within this framework
16:28
but thinking about it more broadly and Mike touched on this before and Philip are on Wednesday indeed about the fact
16:34
that this is a CCS framework the overall value you'll have seen in the pin that was released to the market
16:39
is four and a half billion which enables access from other government departments to be able to use
16:45
some of the mechanisms and methods that we'll be using as part of setting this framework up
16:52
so do we have another slide ah I'm handing over now to Tom skalach
16:57
who's going to uh it's a video message because he can't be here in person today but I hope you'll enjoy this
17:03
presentation
17:10
hi I'm Tom skalach this is me talking about IIT strategy and the relevance to the
17:18
Dallas framework what are the key principles of the hmrc
17:25
technology strategy over the next four to five years the next four to five years ultimately
17:31
we want increased agility reduced risk and a faster time to Market
17:37
our systems are currently constraining us too much taking us a long time to produce Solutions and we have a lot of
17:45
risk from Legacy applications and solutions we want to ultimately reduce the amount
17:51
of applications we've got motor more platform and product based architecture
17:56
set of platforms and products are produced on top of those
18:01
we want strategically adopt the use of cloud ideally with as much as as a
18:07
service as possible ideally software as a service if not platform as a service and below that
18:14
infrastructure as a service ultimately where a vendor can provide a solution to us as a service and we can consume that
18:21
and we can add the value add for hmrc can deliver on top of that for the products which are most fitting to our
18:28
business needs and our customers needs we want to remove a lot of those Legacy
18:34
systems and things that hold us back and things that cause a great deal of technical debts
18:39
overall as a business we're moving to a more digital business we want to reduce the amount of contact that we've got and
18:45
we want to have people self-serve and so we want solutions that can enable that and provide those customer facing
18:51
systems for our customers to to consume the services and interact without taking
18:58
expensive back office human interaction yeah ultimately we want to simplify we want
19:05
less customizations ideally the only configurations and ideally not too many of those we want to
19:11
be working to the systems and of the systems State this is what is common and it's only the particular things that are
19:17
unique to hmrc that we add on top of those we see low code and no code as a big
19:24
part of our future both enabling Business Development to be done inside
19:30
the business and application development to be done there too so they can take power of Their Own
19:36
Destiny and not be hindered from a core set of people that only know specific
19:41
Technologies uh in specific areas we within that we also want the faster
19:47
time to Market so we can quickly prototype and prove the concept and test out the things that we want to have in
19:53
the future and see them as a reality rather than just through documents in a long-lived waterfall style uh
20:01
development um time frame
20:07
But ultimately really want to be moving away from code and it's just those configurations we want a service-based architecture so
20:14
we can consume services and data from the applications where it's needed and
20:20
overall together we have an integrated um ecosystem that delivers to our
20:26
customers and business funds so with all this together we get increased agility
20:31
reduced risk at a faster time to Market
20:38
what are the key technologies that will enable this journey
20:45
there are many technologies that fit those characteristics of what I'm described in this as a service World be
20:52
that software as a service platform as a service or even if they're living on top of an infrastructure as a service and can also
20:59
offer these kind of low code no code faster time to Market style Solutions
21:05
examples of these are sap within both the uh Erp space and also in our tax
21:12
collection and tax revenue Management Solutions service now a nice and power platforms
21:20
or be that through service now with its itsm capabilities or other applications
21:25
like nice and power where we can develop on top of those to find to automate in
21:31
particular areas that are a little bit Niche to us we've got um
21:37
documentum and Pega for managing our documents and our workflow processes
21:44
as well as also advisor uis and simplified user experiences to both
21:52
our customer and our internal user we've got AI Services as well making
21:58
best use of our data Microsoft Dynamics for CRM and other
22:05
case management cases and uses and products like Kong for our API
22:11
management which is a key part of our integration moving forward these are just some examples and there
22:17
are many more thank you what are the key characteristics that we
22:24
are looking for from the supplier on this framework on supplies on this framework we're
22:30
looking with for suppliers that collaborate with us work really closely
22:36
be open to be flexible and agile but come with their deep expertise and deep knowledge what they've got in both
22:43
their product but also where their products being applied within other government departments and in the
22:48
outside world with one vendors and and suppliers who can continue to learn and learn with us
22:56
and learn how best to apply uh these Technologies ultimately we want people who can be
23:02
outcome based delivered to an outcome that that we set that our business and
23:07
our customers need and the vendors and system integrators are prepared to take some skin on the game and deliver to the
23:14
outcome not just the times the materials that could potentially go on forever
23:20
we want people who want to who can understand hmrc both as an organization and as the systems and ecosystems that
23:27
we've got in place right now we can't quickly just move to a green field and forget the old we've got we've
23:33
got to on a journey to coexist both the Legacy and the new
23:41
and ultimately we want people who can take opportunities from the rest of their ecosystem and bring to us
23:47
all the knowledge from the other vendors and other suppliers that they work with
23:52
and other customers and ultimately uh help hmrc do things faster and better
24:01
what else are we looking for from suppliers to help us achieve our vision for it
24:09
the framework is set up to allow suppliers to bring their broad knowledge and experience and learning from other government departments and industries
24:15
into hmrc that's what we want we want to find a
24:21
way to implement the best Solutions the fastest time the reduced cost and the
24:26
reduced risk we want innovators who can help us bring an external perspective see the art of
24:33
the possible and show us what we're potentially missing out on or what the next stage will be and potentially miss
24:39
a few stages out and find intuitive ways to solving problems not just technology
24:44
in certain areas
24:59
oh okay thank you I'd like to now invite Jillian
25:04
Bates to give her presentation she's joining online Jillian good morning good morning morning everyone sorry I can't be in the
25:12
room I couldn't get um it's hard as to be in Newcastle and in London at the same time today so you've got me on
25:18
camera and I'm Julian Bates I'm the deputy director of the digital platform teams within hmrc cdio let me go to the
25:27
next slide please so a digital platform so what do we do
25:32
in the digital platform team um here in hmrc we basically run all of the
25:38
customer face and services that we have in the department and we also run the
25:43
multi-digital tax platform which is the platform in which the services sit on so
25:48
we have the digital channel the digital channels we also have the intelligent Automation and Robotics platform sitting
25:55
in the digital platform team we have the government Gateway platform we have the customer Insight platform and many
26:01
others as well and the services that we have are built and run within the
26:07
digital platform teams they are customer Centric they follow the gdf standards
26:12
and we built they've built it once ethos through identification of common components across all of the digital
26:18
channels we have a portfolio of Digital Services as well as the platforms we've
26:24
got things like the mobile app we've got the G forms we've got iPhones and many many other services including a payment
26:31
service and the hmrc digital is a brand that gives
26:36
hmrc the parity with other government departments such as DWP digital and NHS digital as well and the team has been in
26:43
operation since the beginning of hmrc's digital transformation Journey which was back in 2014 and we have worked with
26:51
multiple suppliers throughout that journey to get to where we are today to increase our own capability and
26:58
knowledge and expertise around hmrc's digital Vision next slide please
27:07
what do we do so we enable the hmrc customer to file serve the tax Affairs through designing and building the cloud
27:13
hosted hmrc services so like say we started back in 2014 with the first
27:20
service being the tax credit renewal service and some of the most recent
27:25
um successes that we've had were the corvid schemes for the job retention scheme the self-employment scheme and
27:30
then more recently this year the new plastic packaging tax scheme as well we designed the digital services for the
27:36
customers so that they are easy to use and like we say to try and help the customer solve through the tax Affairs
27:42
as much as possible try and promote the digital take up across the department
27:47
enhance the systems that we provide support on our digital service by operating the multi-channel digital tax
27:53
platform like I say all services that we build sit on that at the moment connecting with the current um head of
28:00
Duty estate they existing estate the Legacy estate that Tom referred to and our front-end Services connect in there
28:06
to bring the data in and allow the transactions to proceed through managing customer authentication and agent
28:12
authentication through the government Gateway and services as well give people
28:17
the skills to make the most of digital tools and services we work together to support each other in multi-disciplinary
28:23
teams we work in an agile way and we use scrum and we use kanban across the
28:29
digital platform teams we improve the quality of the data to make management policy operational and intervention
28:34
decisions or within the customer inside platform we've got a lot of risk and built in there which helps our customer
28:40
compliance colleagues and then the culture of continuous Improvement of the services and processes so in the Run
28:46
side Water Services built and handed over to our run operation in a devops model we continue to iterate all
28:53
services and keep them as up to date as required and also transform internally through
28:59
intelligent automation like I said we've got the automation delivery Center which is the robotics platform at the moment
29:06
where we are also headed more towards Ai and we've got quite a large RPA presence
29:12
on the estate at the moment and we are moving forward again to try and increase
29:18
the amount of automation that we have in the department to use as many new technologies as possible
29:23
next slide
29:30
this is just a picture of the organization within the digital platform teams just to give you some context
29:36
around the size and scale of what we do and we've got the five digital platform
29:42
centers which are Edinburgh Newcastle leads tell certain Worthen we've also got the multi-digit tax platform team
29:48
which is braced in Bristol and at the moment we've got about 250 permanent
29:53
hmrc staff and 790 contract supplier staff which are provided through a
29:59
multiple contract and scheme that we've got on at the moment through tech services two tech services three and
30:06
through dos five and we currently have around 70 scrum teams delivering a
30:11
substantial pipeline of projects which includes the EU exit Services the making
30:17
tax Digital Services and a single customer account services and obviously we had a change in government of change
30:23
in prime minister sorry yesterday so we are expecting some work to come out of that as well but I say this is just to
30:29
give you some sort of context of the size of the digital platform team
30:34
next slide please for our requirements and the future is
30:41
that Dallas will allow hmrc to procure the suitable skilled supplies to support all aspects of the digital platforms
30:46
work will be defined based on statements of work which is obviously the work packages Define and set outcomes and
30:53
detailed delivery expectations as an example hmrc will expect the supply that
30:58
demonstrates significant experience of all capability in the following so that
31:03
includes the Technologies in the tool sets at the moment we use Scala to build our Digital Services we use play and
31:11
Frameworks mongodb and many others within mdtp within the automation
31:17
delivery Center at the moment we use nice for our RPA and we've recently brought hyperscience under the estate
31:23
for intelligent character recognition as well from Aurora's point of view the
31:28
resources we have aligned to the ddac profession framework which include things like delivery managers product
31:34
managers user researchers designers and many others and practices and
31:40
competencies like I said Agile development we use scrum and kanban across the centers at the moment devops
31:47
and Trust driven development design and user research to develop the
31:52
services in line with the UK government service standards complete and user research working with seldom heard
32:00
groups for example people with access needs all or digital literacy work and line and support and continuous
32:06
Improvement of our services in language slas and upskill and the internal teams
32:11
and collaborative work and one of the big things for us in the digital platform team is that when we work with
32:16
our supplier colleagues is that when you walk into the digital platform team you put your digital platform badge on so
32:23
for me it should be really difficult to try and work out who was a supplier member starting who was an hmrc
32:29
permanent member of Staff because of the way we collaborate and the good work and practices we have across the teams and
32:36
that's a real importance to us next slide
32:44
Financial approach bring in the requirements looking to
32:49
cover the following key elements create a diverse and Innovative Supply base looking for suppliers to really
32:55
demonstrate how they achieve social value in work pass through in local sourceful impact
33:01
looking for supply chain transparency that implies supply chain Partnerships in Supply chains to chmrc as an honest
33:08
broker when Elite suppliers to give their ecosystem supplies the freedom to join multiple Supply chains encourage
33:14
collaboration and also see a contract management step change that will operate on the basis of openness and honesty and
33:21
hope that is okay for everybody and that gives you a flavor of what we do in the digital platform teams and I'll be
33:27
around for any questions in the question and answer session thank you
33:35
thanks Jillian um Richard are you there are you online I am thank you
33:42
yes yes we can hear you thank you fantastic hi everybody so I'm Richard Aldrich I head up the Enterprise
33:49
Integration Services team uh could we move to the next slide please
33:54
thank you so the Enterprise Integration team develops all the internal uh and
34:01
external integration within hmrc uh we we effectively enable internal systems
34:08
to connect to each other as well as managing externally facing apis and file
34:14
transfers we utilize uh on-prem Legacy integration
34:19
as well as cloud-based services so we're predominantly moving to cloud-based Services now
34:27
we manage large and complex integration services that support all the tax
34:34
submissions like things like self-assessment corporation tax and also
34:40
we support all the core customer services and within the team we do Platform and
34:45
development support operations management as well as service support we also help and manage the relationship
34:53
with third-party software companies that build products you utilize our external
34:59
facing apis and also other government departments that are seeking to exchange data with
35:05
hmrc as I said we we own the Strategic
35:11
relationship with the software industry that build at the third party tax products and we help set up the process
35:18
of design influenced by policy uh Eis also enable
35:27
um million billions of pounds of transactions to connect through and be
35:32
processed by hmrc and we use a a multitude of Technologies uh
35:39
most importantly or most recently Open Source Products using and we use agile
35:44
techniques to do our development okay could we move to the next slide
35:50
please so we're currently based over four different locations which are leads
35:56
Telford Bristol and south end we have 140 permanent staff which build which is
36:02
our intelligent client function so we want to use that to retain our expertise and knowledge within the organization
36:08
and we're currently also utilize around roughly around about 360
36:15
supplier-based staff to do mostly in development and platform support work
36:22
okay if you come over to the next slide please thank you so how will we utilize the
36:29
Dallas framework well we require strategic Partners to help us transform
36:35
our Legacy Services we also need suppliers or the partners to provide
36:40
platform support to integrate with our existing teams in some cases and provide
36:46
expertise and also to provide development teams to enable us to
36:53
increase our pipeline of work we're also looking for a mixed economy
36:58
of of uh our contracts of outcomes so some will be fixed price some will be
37:05
outcome based but essentially what we're trying to do is utilize the skills and expertise from suppliers to help augment
37:13
our existing team to help us deliver what we need to do say we're keen to utilize skills and
37:21
experience so we do have an intelligent client function as I said that is trying
37:26
to retain the skills and expertise within hmrc but we want to utilize suppliers where they've got additional
37:33
expertise and knowledge and and help us augment our skills
37:39
and essentially we want to use the Dallas framework to reduce the number of resources overhead within within the
37:46
team and also to help with the the burst capability within the team so when we
37:52
have large demand or a greater demand we want to be able to flex with the
37:57
suppliers that were brought in via the contracts and we move to the next
38:03
Sub-Q okay so what are our strategic imperatives well we want to provide more
38:10
flexible integration services to support future business needs and requirements
38:16
and support innovation we want to migrate off of Legacy
38:21
services that are inflexible expensive to run and don't scale
38:28
we want to deliver integration faster and more effectively and cheaper and
38:34
that will be done through API reuse and also through
38:41
self-serve capabilities so one of the things that we're trying to do at the moment is build a platform
38:47
that utilizes uh or creates a self-discovery mechanism and a
38:53
self-serve Discovery a self self-serve mechanisms that essentially
38:58
helps us to Federate out delivery so that it's not all uh
39:05
confined within the one team within Eis so that we give projects the ability to deliver some of this stuff themselves
39:13
and also we want to make sure that the products that we did develop and deliver
39:19
ensure that we're secure that we meet gdpr and secure customer record
39:26
standards so the benefits of that as I've described is to provide a self-serve for
39:34
an internal and external customers we want to be highly scalable and resilient
39:39
and have a stable set of products we want to simplify our integration
39:45
footprint so we've got lots of Legacy services that we want to reduce
39:50
and have much more flexible systems that are cloud-based and we also want to make them more
39:57
efficient so we want to automate where possible use Auto scaling so that we're cost effective and only utilize
40:04
resources when we need them and we want to a coherent set of
40:10
integration patterns that are easily accessible through self-serve and self-discovery
40:17
um that hopefully reduce time to Market and also the amount of development work that we need to do
40:27
thank you very much um as Julian said I I will also be at
40:32
the uh certain question session later on so thank you
40:38
thanks so much um I just want to say quite a few questions already going up
40:43
on slido so uh please do stick around because Sarah lots of questions to be answered I'd like to do that great
40:50
thanks so much is Dean there please Dean I certainly am I'm out okay thanks we
40:57
can hear you yes okay good hopefully you can um you can see see me as well well whether that's good or not I shall uh I
41:04
shall leave you to work out okay so only one slide if we can move on to the next slide for uh only one slide for us I
41:11
want to talk to you about what borders and trade is in five minutes there's nowhere near enough but I want to give
41:16
you the flavor of what we do and I think the most important thing to take away is we're we're a CIO group so we Face the
41:23
business yeah we um we use we use riches richer team we
41:30
use we use Jillian's team we use all those other um uh delivery groups to form the
41:36
services but we build and we run and we Face policy so
41:41
um very much in that front line facing facing the business delivering the services running and building so a
41:49
couple of things to to call out there are two lenses on us the change lens and
41:54
they're both big okay I think that's the thing you need to take away with the largest portfolio of I.T change in hmrc
42:01
now and ever so we do more delivery work than the cdio puts put together within
42:07
our organization there is a there is a portfolio by the way who am I I'm the portfolio director for change so
42:15
um there's a single program in there which is the largest IT program that HR hmrc or its or its forerunners has ever
42:24
done that's the biggest all right okay that's the Customs decoration service
42:29
but everything facing borders and trade the exploitation of EU exit Northern
42:35
Ireland protocol um changes within our trade structure are us but the Run lens is also
42:42
important we have Circa 150 160 live Services of a range of
42:50
um uh Services possibly in this this this might be a little bit flippant but using every tech tech technology over
42:57
the last 30 40 years not far off Okay so we've got large Legacy estate and our
43:05
Legacy estate or our our entire estate the new services have real world impacts so the pictures
43:13
on the right hand side are there to just bring it real okay for an example
43:18
um and this is where we work with with suppliers to inside borders and freight and I will give you some I will give you
43:24
some numbers now in a minute but we have real world impacts within hours so we
43:30
can break Kent okay if one or two of our systems one major system goes down the
43:36
roads in Kent fill up with lorries we Supply services that enables feel that
43:41
enables felixstow to work which is the largest container port in in in the UK
43:47
they have more services than just us but if we get it wrong they seriously suffer
43:52
and of course Heathrow yeah and ferries uh and that and that and that channel
43:59
too tunnel so the scale of the work that that we're doing let me talk a little
44:05
bit about that over the next three years between run and build it's about one billion pounds worth of uh of work
44:12
roughly uh three quarters of that is in is in change we use over 1 300 staff
44:22
um internals and externals about 800 of those are external Circa the number goes
44:27
up and down um to deliver those services to deliver that change to deliver the live but not
44:34
just that we use 700 resources Circa in areas such as jillians and Richards who
44:41
you've just heard heard from and others we have so trying to get over in that five minutes about the opportunities
44:48
that are here and and the way we are supported by our supplier partners and
44:54
they are partners so um whereas all our contracts are output
44:59
based a lot of the services that we provide effectively we are the service integrators so we have rainbow we have
45:06
rainbow teams of different suppliers performing different roles um inside us we are ddat as professions
45:14
we're PD professions in the main um we are across 18 locations within the
45:20
UK from Glasgow to Belfast to pretty much everywhere else mainly South End and London
45:26
we as well we've heard a few times we're transforming to intelligent client as the rest of uh cdio but we need we also
45:34
need Dallas to assist us not only to build an Iranian output based contracts like I said and burst capacity that not
45:42
just burst capacity but uh as a firm partnership with our suppliers to do
45:50
that build and run but making sure that we are intelligent client to make sure that whilst we use the skills you know
45:57
no other no external knows more about our services than we do but that's not simple in sourcing and Outsourcing it's
46:03
it's not quite as simple as that um lastly about the operating
46:08
environment lens um we um we support multiple systems of
46:14
critical National infrastructure so if you're not conversing with that term other examples are the West Coast main
46:21
main line the M1 but we support the vat data Chief something called gvms which
46:30
handles flow of lorries and can't go through ports Customs decoration service
46:37
and Chief and other various custom services but they have they hold a
46:43
special status within within the UK um what we do we also run intelligence
46:49
systems and services for UK Safety and Security and other ogds pulling that out
46:55
trade alone is worth it's over this now at 800 billion to the UK our services
47:01
collect using Jillian's jilliance teams using Richard's teams but our services
47:09
as a whole collect over 150 billion in Revenue Dallas framework to us is really
47:16
important it's the opportunity to continue using external suppliers in a
47:21
sophisticated way it's a it's it's it's important to us to have those output
47:26
based com contracts we've we are not only are we in the strange rate the
47:32
newest CIO but we're also the oldest so we're quite mature in the way that we work with suppliers deeply and in that
47:40
rainbow way and I will be here for questions I could bang on for days
47:46
um and I have and I have been known to so I shall be here for uh uh questions
47:51
should any occur thank you
47:58
thank you so much that was really uh really helpful David Cooper are you are
48:03
you there yes I am okay everybody so if you could move to the next slide
48:09
please so uh my name's Davey Cooper um I run the case management delivery group so if
48:15
we can move on please so who are we um we're a group of I.T professionals
48:21
who use devops ways of working to deliver Pega documentum and Office 365
48:26
solutions to our customers we Embrace agile ways of working and our
48:32
product teams comprise of a mix of perm staff contingent labor and supplier resources
48:37
we sit inside the hmrc cdio organization so if you could move on to the next
48:43
slide what do we do so um we build enhance and maintain case and content
48:48
Management Solutions across hmrc used by around about 26 000 staff
48:54
our products are used by hmrc colleagues in customer services customer compliance and as you just heard in borders and
49:00
trade directorates our focus is to utilize the case and content Management Solutions to create a
49:06
series of products which are built by our teams who are based in Telford Newcastle and Bristol
49:12
and our teams are responsible for the whole life cycle for a product and we use the Mantra you build it you run it
49:19
next slide this gives you a view a high level view
49:24
of how we're organized and it's mainly within our product teams that we utilize
49:30
supplier resources to help us build and maintain the products that we're responsible for
49:35
so if you'd like to move on again so what I wanted to do here was just
49:41
give you a little bit of a feel for the engagement types that we've used today so whilst I can't guarantee future
49:47
commitments this slide gives you a view of the types of engagements we've undertaken with suppliers using our
49:53
current agreement so you can see they go from very small um short assignments through to quite
49:58
long multi-million pound contract assignments next slide
50:07
um so what am I looking forward to um so I'm looking forward to using the Dallas framework to help me meet the
50:12
demand I have from my customers for new and enhanced case and content Management Solutions my experience today has shown
50:19
me that by us working together and adopting a one-team approach we're able to keep up with the strong demand I have
50:26
suppliers are key for me to be able to satisfy this demand and having the
50:31
ability to tap into a larger capability you all have will be critical for me
50:37
I see my focus has been on utilizing the lots that are on screen
50:45
okay and final slide from me so what are my expectations from
50:50
suppliers well I need to continue to be able to utilize call off agreements for both small and large engagements
50:58
um I will be looking to focus on the technologies that I've listed on screen so Peg a documentum and office 365.
51:04
and I'm hoping that we'll be able to continue to utilize our very simple engagement process that we have with you
51:10
all at the moment so thanks very much and I'm also be here for the Q a session later
51:20
thank you so much Sarah are you are you there I am indeed hello everyone I'm Sarah
51:27
Keith so I'm the head of learning and talent development in cdio um so my role is to make sure that cdio
51:35
so our digital directorate and hmrc that we have the necessary skills and
51:40
capability not only for nine but also for the future so what I'll do is just
51:46
talk to you a little bit about the work that we do what we've done so far and where we're going in the future
51:52
so as we've already spoken about you've already heard we have academies in cedio
51:57
that actually help us deliver professional learning for roles so what this is doing is helping everyone get
52:04
better at the work that they're doing now but we're not just focused on the here and now as I said we're also
52:10
planning for the future as well so one of the key things that we're looking at is how do we help our people develop the
52:17
skills for the future not only in the role that they're in now but how can we help them transform their careers not
52:24
only for their own personal benefit but also for the benefit of the organization
52:29
um so how can we use take people whose skills might not be needed quite so much in the future and help them create
52:36
skills that we are going to need and that are going to be in demand so as I mentioned we've got academies that do
52:41
that for our roles at the moment we have a university in ceio which is part of my
52:49
job I lead the university and what that does is it provides the wrapper for the academies we support all the academies
52:55
we also oversee Learning and Development in cdio in general and the university
53:01
itself as well as a SharePoint site acts as a One-Stop shop for Learning and the
53:06
university in fact is the result of a previous collaboration with one of our suppliers so we're very very keen to
53:13
work with you on innovative ways in which we can build capability
53:18
so we've also mentioned their capability schemes this is something that we're looking at at the moment and we're
53:24
actually developing them and this is really helping us to leverage our
53:29
existing talent to help our people transform their careers help cdio
53:35
develop the capability it needs the future so we're looking at intensive
53:40
courses you know ways in which we can support people to learn whilst also of course not affecting the work that we do
53:47
because learning is integral to everything that we do learning is where Innovation comes
53:53
from so as an I.T organization we need to be learning all the time so it's an integral part of our work nevertheless
54:00
there's also you know that learning training in particular takes time away
54:05
from work so we've got to balance the two so it's finding innovative ways to do this and that's really what I'm I'm
54:12
excited about working with um suppliers you know our existing suppliers and new suppliers as well to
54:19
find different ways of doing that and um you know we're quite happy to
54:24
experiment try new things um do all sorts of you know pilot new
54:29
new ways of doing things so if there's anything that occurs if you think you
54:34
know we'd like to um you know that that you've heard that sort of inspires you hopefully makes you
54:41
think well yes actually that's something that we could help with that's what I'd like to do and as I said you know we're
54:47
very much open to suggest questions we're really not fixed in terms of what we're doing but what what is absolutely
54:54
key to what we do is making sure that we have uh the skills for the future we are
55:00
creating cdio in in hmrc as a learning organization so as I said learning is
55:06
really Central and key to what we do so capability build for us I mean it's incredibly important for me because it's
55:12
it's as you can tell I'm very passionate about it it's my job I love Learning and Development I love supporting people to
55:18
learn but more than that you know making sure the organization has the skills it needs so please
55:23
um you know get your thinking caps on because we really really do encourage any ideas all ideas welcome
55:31
um I will be around for questions later on as well so if you've got any any questions about the work that we're doing now
55:37
um if you'd like to hear any more about any of that then please do do let me know thank you very much
55:47
thank you and thanks to all the speakers that joined us from online and for keeping to time as well we were a bit
55:53
concerned about that but I'm happy to welcome for the path
56:04
so hopefully you'll have picked up from the presentations that were made by the previous speakers that there's a bit of
56:09
a thread running through the way those stakeholders will consume services so in Lot 2 as we described before we've
56:17
got a devsecops approach to the delivery of build services and when we talk Dave
56:22
SEC UPS what we mean is that the same teams that will build the services will ultimately run the services so that then
56:29
means that there's got to be a clear delineation with those services that already exist in lot 3 and the running
56:35
of those services so different modes of operation so there will be different types of contracts that drop into those
56:41
lots you'll have also seen from David Cooper's part of the presentation a lot for is focused on those
56:48
configurable platforms and products and whilst David specifically mentioned
56:54
those that are appropriate to case management delivery Group which are things like pegger and documentum and
57:00
the Microsoft Office 365 platforms the eagle-eyed amongst you will have seen at least nine technologies that were
57:06
mentioned during the course of the presentation they represent the technologies that we
57:11
have today it's not an exhaustive list we may adopt new technologies tomorrow but when it
57:17
comes to thinking about bidding for lot 4. that break between lot 4A and 4B there's
57:25
going to be something really interesting that comes out in the invitation to Tender stage of this in order to get on
57:32
lot 4A you would have to have capability in at least six of those nine name
57:37
Technologies and for lot 4B in two of those nine name Technologies so again Lower barrier for
57:44
entry to smes in that part of the last one and Sarah talked well about the the need
57:50
for us to continue to grow our own capability and to use those academies focused on the Technologies to build
57:55
that skill and capability what we haven't talked about in an awful lot of depth so far is the content of
58:01
lot one and that's deliberately we've left it until this point because lot one is actually
58:07
focused to a great extent on helping to build that intelligent client capability that you've heard referred to repeatedly
58:13
throughout the course of the presentations today it's something that we
58:19
genuinely want to build within the organization because we're moving from a situation in which essentially
58:25
everything has been done for a long period of time by a group of outsourced suppliers and whilst we do have
58:31
significant capability in the organization we do need to build that further so that we can validate and test
58:37
the things that were being told by suppliers on an ongoing basis so part of the approach to building that
58:43
intelligent client capability is to have a group of suppliers who can act as a
58:48
council which will provide advice to Tom skellage as the C team do lead
58:54
and also take on specific tasks and challenges in terms of trying to
59:00
accelerate our transformation because what we want to do over the course of the next three to eight years
59:06
really is to move towards an estate where predominantly it is configurable platforms and products so the quicker we
59:13
can accelerate that the quicker we can get things into the cloud with those configurable platforms the quicker our
59:18
overheads reduce and we have a better cost proposition overall
59:23
so we need the support of the market certainly in the short term to be able to do that as we're building that
59:28
capability but also within that you'll start to see some interesting and Innovative things that we're looking to propose so for
59:35
example the suppliers within that lot may be involved in strategy and architecture design validation and what
59:41
have you and by the way a copy of these slides will be made available for you to get all of the details of the content of
59:47
the lot but there'll be things that you won't have seen hmrc or much of UK government
59:53
do before that we're looking to propose for example facilitated settlers and coder sessions
59:59
now some of you will be aware of what that is you'll have probably been involved in them but the process here is that a supplier set
1:00:06
up a platform takes a problem a business problem with one of our services or
1:00:11
Digital Services or systems that are presented by our architecture team and crowdsources an answer
1:00:18
so put it out to coders developers configurers around the world to provide
1:00:23
answers to those things and a securitized sanitized with the suppliers taking responsibility for securitizing
1:00:29
and sanitizing those answers to come back into hmrc to apply to us in the in
1:00:34
our Real World Systems so there's no hmrc data exposure but there will be solutions that can come back and help us
1:00:41
to accelerate those types of transformation that could be supported by payments that
1:00:48
hmrc could make via the supplier to individual coders Who present solutions that solve problems which again is an
1:00:54
interesting thing that's hmrc and much of government hasn't done before I think only gchq has done that so far in the UK
1:01:01
um but it's becoming bigger in the Dutch government so I would expect it to expand as as time goes on and as we
1:01:07
start moving through the slides we start to look at some of the additional features that we'll see and just to
1:01:14
carry up before we move into this because this is a cross-government framework and will be accessible by any
1:01:20
government Department as well as wider public sector whilst hmrc May well be adopting some of
1:01:28
these things it's not going to be a requirement for the other government departments who are involved to adopt them they'll have to make their own
1:01:34
choices as to whether or not they do but some of those things will involve competition being a default for any
1:01:40
non-commodetized service tailored governance being in place that can help us to really rapidly get to Market
1:01:46
wherever possible tailored calloff contract models again
1:01:52
depending on the size of the requirements and the the length of the engagement we can create tailored
1:01:57
contract models for that um standardized and complementary kpi models we actually have a work stream
1:02:03
going on right now in which we're starting to create a standardized view of what it means to be a supplier to
1:02:09
hmrc in the Dallas environment in the future so you can expect that to be part of the things you will see if you're
1:02:16
appointed to the framework and of course the core social value needs that need to be aligned to for any
1:02:23
requirements over 10 million pounds now there needs to be that social value impact that's included and one of the
1:02:29
things we've been really happy to see is the response to this during the tech sourcing program competitions that we
1:02:35
put out and it's it's abundantly obvious those organizations who view social
1:02:40
value as being for life and not just for Christmas because when we see things like
1:02:46
ecosystems being set up and Lead organizations working in a complementary way with those ecosystem Partners to
1:02:53
create opportunities in local communities working with those ecosystem Partners to
1:02:59
help us to understand how they will impact design Define and deliver right
1:03:04
throughout the life cycle of a particular statement of work we can start to see those organizations that
1:03:09
really want to have that affect that social impact the trickle-down of the economics both to the SME organizations
1:03:16
but also into those local communities where there can be real impact as a result of the things that we do together
1:03:22
Us in government and the suppliers cut out the next slide
1:03:30
so in terms of the the fund allocation Lee mentioned at the outset that there's a real opportunity here for us to for
1:03:37
suppliers to have a fairly sizable slice of the pie that's available now two
1:03:43
billion pounds is an overall forecast is is a big number to start us off with but U.S suppliers are only likely to be
1:03:50
interested in investing to the extent that we would want you to invest if you know you are guaranteed to make some
1:03:55
money from this so one of the options hmrc plans to include in Lots two and
1:04:01
four is the option to direct award on what we're calling a tiered taxi rank basis
1:04:07
so what we'll do is create three value levels and in those value levels the suppliers are pointed to that framework
1:04:13
a lot will literally take turns of getting work packages allocated to
1:04:18
them up to a certain value level we're anticipating at the moment that that figure may be around 40 of the forecast
1:04:25
value of the lot but that's not fixed yet but what that means is that there's a
1:04:31
guaranteed minimum level of Revenue that A supplier should be able to realize from being a lot to and four just by
1:04:37
virtue of being there naturally there will also be competition that will make up at least 60 of the
1:04:45
activity that exists in those lots too but by us putting skin in the game
1:04:50
the idea is that that gets reciprocated by the market you put skin in the game too you bring your 80 and you keep your
1:04:57
a team with us um and whilst this is clearly a wider government framework one of the things
1:05:05
we'll ask suppliers to Warrant as a means of qualifying to be present on the framework is that they can guarantee the
1:05:12
capacity and capability to hmrc and that it won't be diluted by engagements elsewhere
1:05:18
with the other government departments so I guess there's a big forecasting job to
1:05:23
be done for what those sorts of levels might be as other government departments start to adopt the Dallas model as part
1:05:30
of their future plans and obviously the mechanism for a continued competition throughout the life of the framework
1:05:36
we discussed before about the fact that if we're so open in providing information
1:05:42
with our pipelines our architectural designs what work packages are going to be
1:05:47
coming out three months down the line it should enable a very very rapid turnaround so rather than a big
1:05:53
commercial Contracting process essentially we've just put out a statement of requirements you come back to us with your proposal within four
1:05:59
weeks and we'll have boots on the ground very quickly afterwards that's that's the intent and the more that we can do that the
1:06:06
more we'll be able to respond in an agile way to the emerging situations that develop Jillian referred before to
1:06:12
how the covert schemes really created a challenge for hmrc and it's quite
1:06:17
heartening to note that when you consider the fact that when the chancellor at the time Rishi sunak stood
1:06:24
up and announced that there would be schemes introduced for Coronavirus job retention self in self-employment Income
1:06:30
Support schemes the first one of those coronavirus job retention was literally from the ground
1:06:35
to delivery four weeks so if we can industrialize that kind of
1:06:42
model we can respond to many of the things that are likely to happen over the course of the next months and years
1:06:48
particularly as we start to see the focuses shift with a new prime minister and there's certainly going to be a
1:06:54
general election before the end of 2024 who knows it may even be sooner and again we could see Focus shifts again so
1:07:00
we need to be in a position to respond in an agile way to those to those to those things
1:07:08
so in terms of direct Awards we've already mentioned the tiered taxi Rank and it's tiered for a reason now if we
1:07:13
have three value tiers it essentially means that no one supplier gets all the big chunky work one and other suppliers
1:07:19
get all the the crumbs that get wiped off the table everyone gets a chance to rotate through those through those lists
1:07:27
and when we make the awards the way we plan
1:07:33
to structure these is that for the highest value taxi rank the supplier
1:07:38
placed first in the list will become supplier one in the highest value suppliers Place second will be in first
1:07:44
in the medium value and the supplier Place third will be first in the low
1:07:49
value and then the rotation will happen on that order so
1:07:55
the information's on the slide they're about direct Awards again we'll be circulating these so I don't plan to
1:08:01
read them in more detail one thing that's important to point out though is that within procurement legislation
1:08:07
there is a a bias a Prejudice shall we say towards competition
1:08:12
so where something would normally be within one of the taxi ranks or
1:08:18
purchasable through a service catalog hmrc would retain the rate and the option to compete that but the opposite
1:08:25
isn't true if something would normally be within the competition sphere we can't turn it into a direct award
1:08:30
opportunity so just to make that clear and we've got our next slide
1:08:36
many competitions we've already mentioned the extra detail here is that the due diligence that we'll be running to a point suppliers in the first place
1:08:43
is going to be critical to us doing that fast turnaround and the mechanisms actually going to
1:08:48
going to enable our customer groups and platform teams to deploy those rapid sourcing models and using a lighter
1:08:54
touch commercial vehicle so rather than the big 800 page contracts that some of
1:09:00
you have seen from us in the past wherever possible we'll be looking to deliver those in six to eight pages of
1:09:05
information which just reference either a framework document or a an enduring
1:09:10
call off that the suppliers would have as a by virtue of that being appointed to the framework next slide please
1:09:16
and those Innovation approaches we talked about rainbow teams you've had mentioned a number of times today and I
1:09:22
trailed before the fact that we've had awful trouble working out exactly how we can create a situation in which we can
1:09:28
transfer risk while still having suppliers work together and we went back and forth on this for
1:09:35
weeks and weeks and weeks thinking how do we force suppliers to do this and then one day the light bulb went on
1:09:42
and we thought why why are we thinking about forcing suppliers to do anything rather than incentivizing suppliers to
1:09:48
do something so what we're planning to develop as part of this process is a contract
1:09:53
management mechanism where there will be kpi measurements based upon
1:09:58
collaboration with suppliers within the lots that this applies to so predominantly we would look at this
1:10:04
being watch two and four but if you imagine a world in which
1:10:10
you're assigned to deliver a work package and you have kpis linked to that work
1:10:17
package and you can deliver that entirely with yourself or your own supplier team
1:10:23
or with your ecosystem and you can get a tick in the Box you can get paid your Milestone payments for
1:10:30
all of the things that you've delivered and all of that's fine because it works for hmrc but against those kpis you would never
1:10:37
score more than 60 percent out of 100 percent
1:10:43
if you then brought in individuals from other supplier teams you can start to score 70 or 80 or 90 the extent to which
1:10:52
you support other suppliers and their deliveries could take you up to 100 potentially and unlocking those stage
1:10:59
points has the potential then to unlock not just the performance incentives of
1:11:04
being placed really high in a league table that we will keep which you can then report on to other government
1:11:09
departments when you're going through your bidding processes but potentially also unlock Financial incentives too
1:11:15
that would make it worth the while of suppliers to involve individuals from other organizations
1:11:21
why would we want to do that well part of it is about transferring risk but part of it is about giving us the
1:11:26
opportunity to say okay you've taken that risk you've taken the extra King Shilling so to speak
1:11:33
so any issues that exists between yourselves and other suppliers within that group are your issues rather than
1:11:40
our issues as a consequence of that extra incentivization being part of the
1:11:46
agreement but the real benefit for us is the fact that we've come from a world in which
1:11:51
we've had a huge amount of dependence on just one or two suppliers we don't ever want to go back there
1:11:57
and that's not to say anything about those suppliers who are wonderful suppliers but as an organization it
1:12:04
enabled us to fall into bad practice and we want to avoid going back to that bad practice again so by having that bigger
1:12:10
group of suppliers who've got that in-depth knowledge of our estate of the services the products the systems it
1:12:16
enables us to be able to swap suppliers out more quickly and avoid that dependence that has us locked in for
1:12:22
potentially two three four years longer than we could have ever intended to do
1:12:29
information sharing we've already talked about so three year plans we'll be providing which are generally going to
1:12:36
be linked to the spending review periods that are released by the treasury we'll
1:12:41
be able to provide one-year project plans and wherever possible three-month plans identifying which work packages are going to be released that's
1:12:47
predominantly for Lots two and four in lot 3 you will generally because these
1:12:52
are Legacy services that are based on run and sometimes modernization they're likely to be longer contracts from the
1:12:58
outset until those con those uh Services would be slated for decommissioning
1:13:04
and because of the fact that generally speaking all of the intellectual property is produced
1:13:10
for hmrc it becomes hmrc's intellectual property and therefore we would exercise the option to share that intellectual
1:13:17
property with all of the suppliers on the framework to enable them to then pick up work that may have been started
1:13:23
by another supplier so again that openness of the information sharing will help to underpin what we plan to take
1:13:30
forward I mean obviously as suppliers it's entirely on your own heads if you choose to share your own intellectual
1:13:35
property but we'll happily share ours with those who are appointed to the framework next slide please
1:13:42
and of course the SME ecosystem um this is really underpinned by a long-standing Target that government
1:13:47
wants to spend one pound in every three with smes and we achieved a really positive step forward in the tsp
1:13:53
competitions that we did in the first couple of waves in introducing those ecosystems
1:13:58
we're looking to build on that with Dallas but also create more opportunities for smes to contract with us directly whenever possible so those
1:14:05
the B parts of the lot 2B 4B we're looking to try to reduce the barriers to entry reduce insurance requirements and
1:14:13
what have you so they're more attuned to the needs of the smaller organization that still has sufficient scale and
1:14:20
capacity to be able to deliver in conjunction with other suppliers on those lots
1:14:27
and in terms of financial incentivization models one of the models that we're looking to try and introduce
1:14:33
in certain circumstances would be returned on investment-based models which you probably won't have seen from
1:14:38
hmrc before so you'll probably be familiar with the concept of concessions contracts within
1:14:44
the regulations this just really Builds on that to say that we have a requirement
1:14:50
you can tell us that you could deliver the requirement for X amounts of money but that x amount of money could be
1:14:56
something paid to you in return for delivering the requirement or alternatively you could be paid a smaller amount of money
1:15:02
but potentially get a larger reward based on the percentage of the ROI further down the line so it's an
1:15:07
opportunity for suppliers to gain more from a revenue point of view on the
1:15:13
basis of being able to deliver the outcome that we're looking for so again hopefully for us that's something that
1:15:19
will help us to lock in value and avoid having to rework things as we often do today on a time and materials basis
1:15:27
gain share options we're looking to introducing some of the lots of mechanism whereby through open book
1:15:32
where suppliers are appointed if their profit margins from the framework exceed 25 percent they'll then be a netting
1:15:39
approach where there'll be a rebate paid into an innovation Fund in hmrc which
1:15:44
will actually fund some of the activities that take place in lot one such as those facilitated citizen coder
1:15:49
sessions that I talked about before so again there's an opportunity not just to have that remittance but to earn some of
1:15:55
it back potentially too and the minimum workshare commitment we've already mentioned and more detail
1:16:02
of that will be released when we issue the invitation to Tender and uh I'm sure the uh the team who are going to take us
1:16:08
through next step Shannon and um Miriam we'll talk in detail about what dates are the key dates to look out for when
1:16:15
it comes to the release of those materials I think that may be my final slide so
1:16:22
I'm going to hand over to Mike note to take us through the next part of the session ably assisted by Shannon and
1:16:28
Miriam but
1:16:37
you can introduce yourselves uh hello I'm Shannon wood um and I'm a
1:16:43
Dallas we're extreme lead so we've been uh with the project since initiation around April
1:16:49
um I'm Miriam lorok same role as Shannon also working on the Dallas team with hmrc
1:16:54
thank you Mr Happy I'll try and Shout out loud hopefully you can hear me so um ccs are leading this this framework
1:17:01
but we are heavily supported by hmrc and hmrc teams here which is why we're trying to show it as a joint incentive
1:17:08
here and a joint program going forward we we are dependent on the help and support we are running at PACE it is a
1:17:15
large program and there is a lot of work to do so we're trying to push through and working today together
1:17:21
collaboratively to get there um you know we just move on to the next
1:17:26
slide if that's okay so as I said we're ccsr are running the framework it will
1:17:32
follow the normal process um find a tender service will be put out there
1:17:38
and we'll be seeking from multiple suppliers for each lot as you see here in this room and online
1:17:44
there are a lot of people interested in this framework um so yeah I think it is is key and I'll
1:17:50
go through a procurement do's and don'ts later but um you know it is going to be
1:17:55
um very very important to get and answer the questions that are put out there when uh when the tender set out
1:18:03
um the framework is for four years uh and we're putting a value of about four and a half billion as our anticipated
1:18:09
value at this point in time you know and to what we know that hmrc are going to be delivering and what we're talking to
1:18:15
other customers around and other customers being on this call as well um we know they're they're here they're
1:18:21
really interested and really want to work with us to to help and get use of this we know people have got similar
1:18:28
problems um that hmrc have across central government this is a potential solution for them to
1:18:35
deliver against those problems um as Phil has said lots to B and 4B are
1:18:43
structured to be attractive more attractive to smes uh CCS driver reporter will be used to
1:18:50
deliver this um tender uh and please um from my sourcing teams and policy
1:18:57
teams Karma reduction plans will be a key element of this to to be to be put onto the either through the at SQ stage
1:19:04
so please start pushing those getting those ready um ready to be presented back
1:19:10
uh and if you need to know any more detail about that please go to the CCS website to to look at that and as Phil
1:19:17
said this presentation will be put onto the CCS um website um on the Dallas Page so please uh look
1:19:25
at look at that as well
1:19:32
as Mike said but this is a fine attender service um we're using flight attend the service and it'll be a restricted procedure so
1:19:39
first we'll have the SQ that will come out with this is due to come out on the 6th of October
1:19:44
and you'll have about 30 days to respond it'll be a combination of pass fail and quality questions that are backwards
1:19:51
looking looking at your past experiences you're gonna get our steps in stepping
1:19:57
up and down on this and so as you can see the invitation to Tender will be released following that we're looking at
1:20:03
release in approximately February 2023 and so whereas as Miriam said the SQ
1:20:09
will be backwards looking questions based on your experience the ITT will provide forward-looking questions so
1:20:15
that could include case studies scenarios and face-to-face presentations and so you'll have approximately six
1:20:21
weeks to respond to the tender and we expect our internal governance to be completed around September 2023
1:20:27
following that outcome letters will be issued and suppliers will be awarded to the framework shortly afterwards
1:20:36
okay so the do's and don'ts of procurement uh housekeeping look um I I
1:20:43
don't really want to say choose to suck eggs but we do see time and time again suppliers not completing the
1:20:50
documentation correctly and then complaining that they don't get onto the Frameworks you know this is going to be
1:20:57
competitive um there is going to be only a few places available on each of the Lots so
1:21:03
please read all the guidance to the tender all the documentation perhaps any public
1:21:09
published clarification questions will be putting those through the relevant rival system
1:21:15
send all related contracts via the messaging function on on Bravo um so we can keep a track and keep
1:21:21
managing that uh clarification questions um we'll go through at the end of where
1:21:27
we're going to put those questions between now and when release um but but please
1:21:32
um put those clarification questions in early for it for us and we can give you that information
1:21:38
and keep up to date with the published clarification questions and responses going through okay please don't do anything the last
1:21:46
minute allow plenty of time to get yourself ready prepared um and supported for for your response
1:21:53
cross reference without the responses across your tender what we see so often is
1:21:59
um misalignment of the information yeah please do a final QA check
1:22:04
um it helps us better quality responses are easier for us to read include attachments where there have
1:22:10
been specifically requested sorry don't include attachments where they have been not requested
1:22:16
um yeah you'll be clear the questions will be clear we'll try and make it clear that you can't add things but
1:22:22
please check and check again um and state the cubs named customer
1:22:28
references details that are confidential um we will adhere to those confidentially confidentiality markings
1:22:35
on those okay all mandatory questions and
1:22:41
questions relevant to your bid um need to be answered um the questions and within the
1:22:48
character limits so please pay attention to that there is a set reason that we put them there for that for those
1:22:54
lengths um we're looking for the information to be relevant in that area so please make
1:23:00
sure you read that area all mandatory fields and tables to be completed um you know we're not clear what what
1:23:07
we're having there yet but you know if you have any questions when that comes out make sure you respond back to us
1:23:13
um we'll make sure they're all relevant for you to put in and we'll give you the details and instructions how to complete those
1:23:20
um so yes sir please marketing um we don't want to hear the marketing
1:23:25
responses we want to make sure that there is relevant detail in able to support your responses that's that's
1:23:32
clear and concise and then check um just a final check your organization
1:23:39
details are accurate um any T's disease you're uncertain with please ask the questions make sure your
1:23:44
legal teams are engaged uh with those uh you cannot include any attachments um
1:23:51
so where we've asked for attachments please include those where you haven't where we haven't please do not uh but be
1:23:57
please check and be clear about that uh the character character count limits
1:24:03
will be imposed uh so if you run short they won't be used and won't be uh put
1:24:10
in or sorry if you run over those they won't be counted in your overall response we'll cut it off at the limit
1:24:15
that we've set okay thanks again
1:24:21
and so we've included in the Packer provisional timeline so as we've got seven different Lots in the framework
1:24:27
we've split it into two different phases so phase one will include Lots 2A 2B 3
1:24:32
and 5. and as I said the SQ will be issued on the 6th of October and we're
1:24:38
going to issue with the slide pack afterwards so if you don't get your photo in now you can look at it afterwards and and then we look thing
1:24:44
for phase two to be launched next summer um yeah and we're going to talk about the
1:24:51
market engagement two sessions that we're going to be running as a follow-on to this event
1:24:58
and so today is their first Market engagement session we're also looking to do our one-to-one sessions as you can
1:25:04
see on the screen they'll be face to face and they'll be allocated on a first Confessor basis
1:25:10
um please remember that you'll be allocated one slot um and there won't be opportunities to change their date or
1:25:16
time if that allocated slot and we're going to collate all the questions and answers and from those sessions and
1:25:22
we'll anonymize and publish those following the event the sessions will be held in Birmingham and if you're
1:25:28
allocated a slot on a day that's affected by rail strikes then you will have the option to dial in virtually the
1:25:35
team from ccs and hmrc will be there in person so you can come in person if you wish to and as you can see there's just
1:25:41
a reminder at the bottom the dates for uh the slots for wave one is the week
1:25:47
commenced in the 26th of September so last week in September and that includes Lots 2A 2B 3 and 5. we'll issue more
1:25:54
information on the slots for Wave 2 next year
1:26:00
foreign 's already hinted at after the SQ has
1:26:05
been released or all questions or clarification questions will be directed through the CCS Bravo e portal prior to
1:26:13
that we've got at the end of the presentation you'll see um a few Dallas email addresses that you can use to
1:26:18
contact us or we've also got a registration form for the market engagement event where you'll have some
1:26:24
space to ask questions and obviously in the sessions as well and as Shannon said they will all be released they'll be
1:26:30
collated anonymized and released as part of the um as part of the tender process for the
1:26:36
public and so lastly if you do want to register
1:26:43
for a face-to-face one-to-one session you can use the link on the screen or
1:26:48
you can scan the QR code you can also use that form to ask any questions that you may have and we'd welcome some
1:26:53
feedback too the QR code will be on at the end of the presentation if you need to take a photo of it then
1:26:59
just um numbers at Birmingham we're using CCS offices in Birmingham so there will be
1:27:06
limited numbers of supplier attendees um per supplier three so so just three
1:27:13
three supplies for each of the sessions okay
1:27:20
thank you
1:27:26
thanks so much uh for that presentation uh Phil I don't know if you want to come up uh to field any questions that we
1:27:33
have we're now moving on to uh question and answer session we have quite a few
1:27:39
on slido at the minute actually quite a few have been answered as the as the
1:27:44
presentations have gone on so um so I'll sort of maybe take this
1:27:49
opportunity to go through a very popular one that may or may not
1:27:55
be controversial but I'll ask it anyway it says um as Philip said yet another framework are you saying that none of
1:28:02
the existing Frameworks uh to supply these project skills and roles are exist
1:28:07
already including the new DSP essentially why why do we need this one on top of what we already have
1:28:16
oh sorry um Ali could you sorry
1:28:32
yeah it's a really good question I'm sure Michael have a perspective on this too but essentially what we're not
1:28:38
saying as a result of this framework is that there are not some excellent Frameworks already in existence with ccs
1:28:44
what those Frameworks don't do however is allow us to achieve some of the things we want to achieve as a result of
1:28:52
uh putting Dallas in place so we talked about ongoing competitive tension we
1:28:57
talked about information sharing we talked about the opportunities for very rapid competition
1:29:03
we can only really do those things in the the setting of having a framework that has a smaller number of suppliers
1:29:10
on each of the Lots where those suppliers are become familiar and develop Partnerships with us in a very
1:29:17
rapid period of time so that they can understand how we do business and by virtue of those things enable us to have
1:29:23
those quick competition turnarounds in four to six weeks to respond with agility to the things that develop so
1:29:29
whilst there are some exceptional Frameworks in place that covers some of these things they don't do them in quite
1:29:35
the way we need to move forward within hmrc and there are a number of other departments as Mike mentioned before
1:29:40
that are in precisely the same boat and are looking to use some of the principles that we're trying to introduce here but Mike did you want to
1:29:48
adjust on that yeah just to add to that that you know part of the early days of this program we we challenged each other
1:29:54
hmrc and CCS around what Frameworks could align and how could we align those
1:29:59
Frameworks and and make their work for what hmrc were wanting to deliver and
1:30:05
wanted to get out of it and what we come to is that actually there is no perfect scenario for us and this actually helps
1:30:12
us and when we talk to other customers this is also an effective mechanism to help them as well
1:30:18
I think just to add as well that hmrc has always been quite aware of the fact that we're a bit of a canary in a coal
1:30:24
mine on this particular one because if some of the principles and mechanisms
1:30:29
that we're looking to introduce actually work well and have the utility to start to scale across other government
1:30:35
departments there are things here that could become much more commonplace within CCS Frameworks of the future and
1:30:41
there's already deliberations happening in relation to tech services four I understand to start to think about how
1:30:46
that could be shaped with some of the principles that we're looking to introduce here yes definitely
1:30:52
um new regulations coming in next year for us as well maybe help move things along so again we're thinking of you
1:30:59
know thinking of models that help our customers um going forward thanks Mike
1:31:06
thanks are there any questions in the room anybody in the room have a question
1:31:13
uh Julia we have a question we just need the mic so that those online can also
1:31:18
hear as well so yeah if right down in the front here Julia could you just as you ask me a question if you could at
1:31:24
least your name in which organization did you raise your hand so Juliet thank you
1:31:30
let's see um can you mentioned that um
1:31:43
so we can expand a little but obviously the um the ITT packs aren't going to be
1:31:48
going out until February so there's still some more development to be done and some of that development will actually happen as a consequence of some
1:31:55
of the conversations that we have in Birmingham at the end of the month because as has been mentioned we don't want to close the book on the art of the
1:32:01
possible if there's something that can genuinely help us proposition that we have here
1:32:06
um but the essentially what we were thinking about is that in lot 2A and 4A where we have
1:32:14
larger suppliers we would set a mechanism whereby if the profit margin that was generated from
1:32:20
the framework exceeded 25 then in bandings above 25 percent it would be
1:32:26
possible to remit a percentage of the excess profit above 25 into Innovation
1:32:32
funds and those Innovation funds would then enable us to fund things like the
1:32:38
facilitated citizen coder sessions or potentially prototyping activity that may come into
1:32:44
the the area of lot one so that's that's the broad principle that we're looking to apply but the exact bandings and what
1:32:50
the values are on there we haven't settled on yet
1:32:56
another question here
1:33:02
thanks Holly thanks so much Chris Farthing advice Cloud um if an SME was to apply uh directly
1:33:08
for the lots of relevant for can they also still apply for the supply chain ones as well as in going going alongside
1:33:13
with the big boys absolute PS um yeah there's also some some advantage in
1:33:21
that I would I would suggest because it enables uh greater opportunity to flex across different lots for some views
1:33:28
possible so we're definitely Keen to encourage encourage that the only
1:33:33
restriction that we're actually making is that you cannot Supply on both lot 4A
1:33:39
and 4B as the same lead supplier um and lot 2A and 2B so it applies on
1:33:46
both of those both of those parts of the framework
1:33:51
anymore oh Julia
1:33:58
hi it's uh Rob Malcolm from dxc I've got a process question if that's okay in
1:34:04
terms of the SQ itself the intent of the SQ I assume is to down select the number
1:34:09
of supplies to take forward to the ITT could you just describe that process and how many you were expecting to take
1:34:16
through to that next phase and then if you could just further expand on how many you supplies to expect to see on
1:34:22
each lot at the end of the process many thanks so we may actually be able to get the slide back potentially which
1:34:29
identifies how many suppliers were intending to appoint to each of the lots for the SQ phase you are absolutely
1:34:36
right it's it's being used to narrow the list down so that it doesn't become too great a an evaluation headache for the
1:34:44
department and for CCS because with something this new um if we were to end up having to plow through hundreds and
1:34:51
hundreds of tenders then it could potentially delay us from a timeline point of view and hmrc is very much on
1:34:57
the clock with this because we're looking to try and get it in at a time roughly around the expiry of the initial
1:35:03
terms of some existing contracts so that that's what's driving some of those decisions but broadly speaking we're
1:35:10
looking to down select to double the number of suppliers that we intend to
1:35:16
appoint to the framework a lot now there may be one or two variations around that particularly if you end up with unlock
1:35:22
one for example the suppliers that are our 10th and 11th on the list if they score identically then we would probably
1:35:28
take them through on an identical score but generally we will set the set the
1:35:34
level and and cut off everything below that level but broadly speaking we're aiming for double double the figures
1:35:39
that you see on the screen there
1:35:45
hi uh Ed development Triad just carry on from Chris's question as an SME we will
1:35:50
be able to apply with other Primes in the same lot if that makes sense thanks
1:35:57
so just to understand the question then so if there are five primes in lot 2A
1:36:03
yes could we join or apply with several primes within the same lot
1:36:09
yeah absolutely um I mean obviously the there will be
1:36:14
um conversations and discussions that you will enter into with those primes about the nature of the working
1:36:20
agreement that would exist between you but we would want to place no constraint on any supply chain members from
1:36:28
operating with with multiple suppliers across those lots so I suppose technically you could end up as a as a
1:36:34
supplier for five of the lead suppliers within one of the lots and also as a direct supplier in the B part of the lot
1:36:40
which um for smes might maximize your opportunity to uh to generate business
1:36:46
um but obviously um we've talked a lot about capacity we've talked a lot about capability and
1:36:52
that is important to us and so I think the openness that we're looking to develop in the partnership
1:36:58
arrangements with the suppliers would necessitate a situation where we would
1:37:04
have to have fairly robust conversations if suppliers were bite enough more than they could chew
1:37:10
and likewise I think when we come to qualifying suppliers to be appointed to
1:37:16
the Lots we will be looking at Financial standings to just determine whether or not they would be capable of at very
1:37:22
least meeting the type of minimum workshare commitments that we would be proposing for the lot
1:37:29
thanks I will take another question that came in on online
1:37:35
um there's a question about will there be any situation where you may still procure via other Frameworks such as dos
1:37:41
or gcloud so I think the quick answer to that is we we wouldn't want to constrain
1:37:47
ourselves so whatever options are available we'll do an analysis a commercial analysis and
1:37:52
determine what the best route to Market is from a strategic point of view for hmrc it would make sense for us wherever
1:38:00
possible to put as much work through the Dallas framework as possible and there's no loss to CCS from that either because
1:38:06
obviously being a CCS framework it attracts the levy so whenever we spend through this becomes a virtuous circle
1:38:13
for all of government in terms of spend under management but as things start to
1:38:19
move forward you may start to see the other forays into the market that hmrc has
1:38:24
made in things like data and sap start to unify under this type of approach in
1:38:30
future iterations too another one uh from online
1:38:37
um Can hmrc facilitate introductions or contact sharing for a larger primes and
1:38:42
interested smes Mike do you want to take that
1:38:50
yeah so CCs is uh kindly volunteered to facilitate those arrangements okay
1:38:55
thanks [Music] um could you please list the distinct nine
1:39:02
Technologies so the nine Technologies are on the slide deck which is okay CCS website but
1:39:09
um I'm Testament memory now but the Pega systems Microsoft Dynamics Microsoft
1:39:14
Power Platform Office 365 apps Kong document um nice
1:39:19
and sap yes so
1:39:26
well done thank you there's a question at the back hello there Chris Gallagher
1:39:31
confluent I'm looking at the annual values and the number of suppliers the primes are still going to have to be fairly large I would
1:39:37
argue because they are they're large annual values right will you be spelling out what a good Prime will look like I'm
1:39:46
not saying names but what good would look like if you see what I mean because I think that would be extremely useful thank you interestingly the um I
1:39:54
mentioned before about the work stream that we've just set up and Rich may want to talk a little bit more about this in
1:39:59
a moment but um we've just set up a work stream looking at um a a broad brush picture of what we're
1:40:06
looking for from suppliers both in terms of the characteristics of the supplier the capacity their capability their
1:40:12
ability to work in partnership with us their ability to collaborate with other suppliers and the types of
1:40:20
um activities they would be expected to deliver deliver and the standard kpi sets that would apply to all of the
1:40:25
suppliers in certain lots that that is happening as we speak um so hopefully that will address an
1:40:31
awful lot of the the content of the question there but I'm happy to hand over to
1:40:37
sorry Rick
1:40:42
thank you smiling advice card again um to mind uh this is going to be services-based
1:40:48
procurement isn't it you're not looking for the supplier to actually Supply the technology as well are you no it's it's
1:40:54
purely Services based and I mean obviously it was it was covered in the presentation that over time there will
1:41:00
be a shift away from coding toward configuration so those technologies will
1:41:06
already exist as either platform as a service or software as a service and then the services will be work packages
1:41:12
involved in configuring those services for specific um use cases
1:41:19
thanks um I'll take one from from online how will hmrc integrate social value in such
1:41:26
a large and long framework I think that's a to be concluded
1:41:33
so there will definitely be detailed information when it comes to the um the ITT stage
1:41:39
what we've done on this in the past though is we've focused on four action themes generally which are to do with
1:41:45
well-being societal impact uh equality and we've previously looked at covert
1:41:50
recovery and particularly the impact on local communities when it comes to code recovery but that's less of a a
1:41:57
challenge now so we may just major on on three of those areas rather than rather than four moving forward but um
1:42:04
certainly when it comes to sustainability and carbon reduction it's already been trailed in the presentation
1:42:09
around how the carbon reduction plans need to be made available I understand that it's going to be a requirement of
1:42:15
the SQ phase that those carbon reduction plans will be put on suppliers websites
1:42:20
with a link provided in the SQ return so just to trail that well in advance
1:42:27
as well as producing the plan it needs to be present on your website when you submit the SQ
1:42:33
great um what is hmrc's appetite to offshoring is this seen as part of the future mix
1:42:43
so it's a good question and it came up repeatedly during the tsp um procurements that we did
1:42:50
I think the short answer is that we wouldn't want to constrain ourselves when it comes to opportunities but there
1:42:56
is and is all has always been a small P political issue when it comes to
1:43:01
offshoring particularly at a time when from a financial point of view an economic point of view
1:43:08
there's there are struggles within the country there's the potential for the effect of inflation and energy cost
1:43:13
Rises and what have you to affect employment so the small P political side of things
1:43:19
is the question of whether or not it would be right for us to Offshore certain things at a time when there may
1:43:24
be a threat to employment in the UK so we always have to balance those things out under any circumstances we do not
1:43:32
offshore data so all data is in the UK but we we wouldn't say no never to other things
1:43:38
but it would have to be taken on a case-by-case basis so and I will just say Brooke for other
1:43:45
customers they may wish to have offshore in so you know we're not going to exclude it at the framework level it's
1:43:51
whether it's used and utilized within the call-off level that's going to be relevant
1:43:59
thanks we have a question about are there any mandated certifications or
1:44:05
accreditations that all suppliers need to have ISO for instance
1:44:13
yes we're working we're working through all of those um and making sure we got the right
1:44:18
accreditations the right levels with their cyber security cyber Essentials um whatever it is we'll make sure that's
1:44:25
clear about what it is we're asking for um but we will need to make to make sure that they are
1:44:31
um the recognized bodies that are all grows those uh accreditations
1:44:38
and just to to expand on that that the pack we mentioned before what it means to supply to hmrc pack essentially will
1:44:44
start to lay out some of that detail too around what accreditations would be essential to work with hmrc
1:44:51
um specific to the framework when you think about Lot 4 and the fact that that is focused on specific strategic
1:44:58
Technologies our expectation would be that for the technologies that you report for wanting to supply you would
1:45:04
be accredited to at least silver status with the technology vendor
1:45:09
we have one in the back and then we'll come to you so yeah a bit of a boost guide question I guess Phil but what's
1:45:16
the percentage ratio of the money being spent going to be to large-scale programs as opposed to
1:45:22
smaller ones on the top 2B do you think out of 150 million it was all spent so at the moment
1:45:29
um it's impossible for us to state that with any certainty but broadly speaking what we're looking to do is allocate on
1:45:36
the basis of work packages and the way things stand work packages with a value
1:45:41
in excess of a million pounds will go into the a part of the lot less than a million pounds
1:45:49
will go into the B part of the lot and there'll be figures below a million pounds for the B part of
1:45:55
the lot that will then make up the um the levels for all the tiers for the taxi rank allocation of work
1:46:05
go ahead hi uh Phil it's David Hunt from Lidos
1:46:10
um for tsp there was a sort of Drop Dead date that was the expiry of the Aspire
1:46:16
and other contracts in the June time frame this year um you mentioned this is time
1:46:22
constrained or time pressured what are the time constraints that are causing you to stick to this particular times
1:46:29
table that you've offered now well you're right it's more time pressured and time constrained with
1:46:34
Dallas um but we do have of the contracts that we let under tsp as as Lee referenced
1:46:40
earlier on we always knew that a lot of them would be stepping stone contracts because we wouldn't be at a state of
1:46:46
maturity to enable us to move to the type of operating model
1:46:52
um but of those contracts I believe 19 of the 32 contracts that
1:46:58
we've seen immediately within scope of Dallas will expire between September 2023 and January 2025 so consequently as
1:47:07
those initial terms expire we'll be looking as early as possible to move them into this structure
1:47:15
thanks will suppliers be expected to provide people to work on the customer site or
1:47:21
is remote working allowed so we've switched to virtually all remote working within hmrc now following
1:47:28
covid um and we we don't anticipate that changing markedly but obviously there
1:47:34
will be requirements at times to attend in person and and they would be uh detailed in the the statements of work
1:47:41
and call offs that are generated okay thank you but there's one in the room
1:47:50
hi Clive Friedman from log point my question is not so much about the framework but more about the drivers so
1:47:56
in your presentation you talk I saw at least 1500 contractors and I'm sure
1:48:01
there's many multiples more in hmrc what would good look like as a result of this in terms of the contractors given that
1:48:08
the contractors also have the corporate memory of hmrc and the objective is to move in-house what would be the position
1:48:16
of looking at those contractors as potentials for assisting in whether it
1:48:22
be SME or into Indie primes to tap
1:48:29
well certainly for anyone who wanted to bed we wouldn't discourage contacting
1:48:34
the organizations that are in hmrc operating today because an Institutional memory may well be useful in helping you
1:48:41
to create bids and subsequently to deliver services I think ultimately in terms of what good
1:48:47
would look like and what we're trying to achieve it's very much about that shift towards intelligent clients and again
1:48:53
I'll give Rich the opportunity to come in on that one possibly uh yes I think that this part about moving
1:49:00
to intelligent clients um and but I think the framework is about really shifting to outcome pieces of work being
1:49:05
able to contract uh for outcomes and taking smaller more self-contained piece
1:49:12
of work within that ecosystem of Partners on the framework which which is part of that journey and being able to
1:49:18
separate the work and deliver work in small in small chunks is is really part of delivering that strategy uh for hmrc
1:49:27
so retaining that knowledge the intelligent client knowledge in-house but having that ecosystem of Partners to
1:49:32
deliver those outcomes for us through a a flexible framework
1:49:37
and I think um our cdio dalgia it's been on record as effectively saying about
1:49:43
how we as an organization need to balance better how we work with the market so whilst the intelligent client
1:49:49
improves on our side of the house there would be more opportunities for us to put things out to the market that we
1:49:55
currently do today largely using contingent labor or in some case of
1:50:01
resource-based contracts with suppliers rather than outcome-based ones that we're looking to move towards here
1:50:09
I'm very conscious by the way that there's been very few technical questions and we've got Jillian and Rich
1:50:14
and Dean sat waiting with baited breath for any technical questions so if you do have them
1:50:21
I don't this probably doesn't qualify as a technical questions of apologies but um
1:50:27
it was mentioned that there will be open book requirements can you please expand on this
1:50:33
um it's a standard within all government contracts that generally we would um require suppliers to submit to open
1:50:40
book uh costing and for us to have um open book reviews periodically that we
1:50:45
can commission it's not a given that we will commission them but that we could commission
1:50:51
um I think in the Lots where we would be looking at gain share as a means of funding Innovation it would be more
1:50:57
likely that we would assert that right perhaps more frequently but yeah it would be as as it is in
1:51:04
other government contracts where we get that level of detail to enable us to understand the impact that Dallas
1:51:10
Activity is having on the uh the bottom line for your organization
1:51:16
thank you is there a detailed list of services or
1:51:21
Pipeline and how they map to each of the Lots this may help suppliers prioritize the most appropriate Lots
1:51:29
so what we have at the moment is a list of contracts that are directly within
1:51:34
the scope of Dallas and we're in the process through a work stream of building exactly that details of the the
1:51:40
types of work packages that will exist and how they map to to the various Lots
1:51:45
within the framework so that will be made available at the ITT stage
1:51:50
this is uh good morning my name's Robbie I'm
1:51:57
from cloud Source I'll ask a certainly cool question um for lot four you thanks for like
1:52:03
naming the technologies that you want suppliers to provide I'm curious though
1:52:09
to try and differentiate my organization whether we bid in lot 2B or in lot 4B
1:52:16
um lot to be a lot lot twos about digital services so what what outcomes
1:52:22
are you looking to generate in lot for so the difference fundamentally is that
1:52:28
in Lot 2 the the digital build services that will be
1:52:34
aligned to the digital delivery centers to borders and trade and for Enterprise Integration will be largely done on a
1:52:41
devsecops Model but using um code of codable technology so things
1:52:47
like scalar and Java and and some of the uh various other technologies that Jillian mentioned in her presentation
1:52:53
the difference with Lot 4 is that it's all focused on configurable technology
1:52:58
and so anything that comes into that sphere of being a configurable product
1:53:04
or platform either from the list that we've provided earlier or get added to later on will automatically slot into
1:53:11
Lot 4 and be configured rather than coded thank you
1:53:17
another one from online how does the low code no code platform strategy affect
1:53:23
how current Digital Services that are bespoke or code developed in the future will that change
1:53:30
so rich do you wanna um so I think if uh from from Tom's
1:53:36
Video the future is to move to a a much more of a platform uh based architecture
1:53:43
building on top of that primarily you're trying to use low code and no code Solutions as much as possible but I
1:53:50
think as as this was was trailed up front this is part of a longer journey to move from from a lot of Legacy
1:53:57
systems so we're going to be shifting that architecture over a period of time so um that will that will be part of the
1:54:04
digital Journey that hmrc goes on uh ideally we'll we'll introduce more and more of those Loco Technologies as we go
1:54:12
along but we have to understand where we're starting from um and need to build on that so so it allows us to evolve to that state of
1:54:19
over over the next few years I think from a commercial perspective as
1:54:25
well just to build on that you'll notice from the annual values that have been cited on the screen in front of you that
1:54:31
there is more money currently focused on the digital development side of things than there is on the configurable side
1:54:37
of things um what will happen over time is that we will start to see a shift of money and
1:54:44
potentially it might be iteration two or whatever the successor for Dallas becomes we'll start to see money more
1:54:50
money shift into the configurable platforms than we see today um but within the life cycle of this
1:54:56
framework and possibly even within the life cycle of its successor we're not going to get away from doing scholar and
1:55:03
Java stack coding deployed on our multi-channel digital tax platform those services will still exist it's
1:55:10
just that more there'll be a greater preponderance into Lot 4 over time
1:55:17
foreign okay um well Pega documentum development work
1:55:26
be a part of this framework absolutely yes
1:55:34
is there a specified security clearance per lot
1:55:39
so it's not specified per lot it's more specified on the basis of the type of work that's being done so generally any
1:55:46
work that involves use of live data requires SC clearance uh where there's no live data involved unless there's
1:55:52
something specific that requires it to be have a higher security classification generally bpss is sufficient
1:56:01
to say again that your framework level dependent hmrc may call it off in their
1:56:06
in their call off contracts other customers May utilize and ask for different things so it's it's going to
1:56:12
be as and when required the school off
1:56:18
can you confirm the criteria to be used to assess a supplier as an SME what if
1:56:23
the organization grows beyond this definition during the framework period
1:56:29
So the appointment is made at the start of the framework and so the supplier would remain on the framework within
1:56:35
that lot for the period of the framework in terms of the definition of SMA cabinet office has a specific definition
1:56:41
which relates to the amount of employees and the turnover but it's specific to
1:56:47
um its operation as a worldwide entity so for example an organization may be an
1:56:54
SME according to the numbers but if they have an overseas parent they can't be an SME technically because
1:57:01
the parent can provide company guarantees or access to wider market capitalization
1:57:11
here we go Julia well it's for the people online so that they can hear you as well
1:57:18
so it's David I'm from Lidos again um to what extent are the is the SQ
1:57:25
going to be set against hmrc's criteria as opposed
1:57:31
to the criteria that may reflect other departments requirements
1:57:36
at the moment and I'm sure Michael uh come in if I get any of this wrong but
1:57:41
at the moment we're jointly developing the SQ with ccs so that there will be a
1:57:46
flavor for both so hmrc's requirements will come into that but ccs are also
1:57:52
having a major input into that content but as um Shannon and Miriam mentioned before our anticipation is that the SQ
1:57:59
process is very much around looking backwards what are the skills capabilities experiences of you having
1:58:06
delivered in organizations of a similar size and scale to hmrc in this kind of operation where
1:58:13
there would be supplier collaboration greater information sharing all of those things were looking to test based on
1:58:18
your experiences in the past and then when we get to ITT phase it's very much going to be about what are you
1:58:24
going to do for us today and the Monty Python one of the Romans done for us lately kind of sense and the
1:58:31
needs will be very similar whether it's hmrc or another department
1:58:36
um they'll be very similar around what the criteria we're setting at the SQ level so it is CCS are leading that
1:58:44
input from um from Phil and the team plus our other knowledge of what's going on there
1:58:54
because I think that's a follow-up question Julia
1:59:02
of course yes yeah we we recognize that it is but we think we'll be we'll work
1:59:09
through enough that we'll get a a good balance which will work for the framework
1:59:18
someone is asking um how many slots are available for the face-to-face one-to-one sessions
1:59:25
so we've set aside enough capacity uh within the week in Birmingham to
1:59:31
accommodate um around 100 suppliers okay during the course of that week we'll have
1:59:38
um five five teams available but we can Flex up to six depending on uh uptake and as Mike mentioned before there's a
1:59:45
limit of um three representatives for each supplier organization during that week but um it's uh it's an opportunity
1:59:53
to to meet us face to face to ask us questions to make suggestions and hopefully uh we it can be a mutually
1:59:59
beneficial Arrangement just to reiterate though any questions that we are asked in that setting we will be capturing and
2:00:05
publishing as part of our responsibility to be fair and transparent to all of the bidders
2:00:14
thank you is it worthwhile for hmrc to consider large-scale Enterprise Integration
2:00:19
Services as a dedicated lot separate to although joined up to product development
2:00:28
we have considered that as a commercial approach But ultimately we landed on the
2:00:34
fact that our technology journey is very much around working to configurable platforms and
2:00:41
products so it becomes more about products than it does about lines of business and about lines of service and
2:00:48
that's that's how we decided to structure the the framework I I guess it's um there's no wrong answer as to
2:00:55
how you would want to structure it but because we want to take that product centered approach in the way that we take the transformation forward it
2:01:01
seemed to be the most sensible split
2:01:07
could you please confirm the SQ date is it the 6th of October
2:01:13
with a 30-day return I.E mid-november yeah yeah the 30-day
2:01:18
um is statutory we we give 30 days for the return of the SQ
2:01:23
okay which clouds are hmrc using and expecting to use will product vendor
2:01:29
clouds also be used servicenow for example or Pega cloud
2:01:38
so today at hmrc in terms of infrastructure as a service predominantly uses AWS and
2:01:46
azure um but as Tom raised in his presentation we want to over time move more away from
2:01:53
iwas into platform as a service and software as a service so that wouldn't necessitate the actual vendor software
2:02:01
being served from their side of the firewall into our side of the firewall
2:02:06
and then configured on our side of the firewall
2:02:12
will there be will bespoke performance certificates be required to prove skills
2:02:18
and experience in developments I think is the the way
2:02:24
to answer that we will come out with more detail on that but we're working through what that would need to look like when it comes to the um the Itt
2:02:31
okay and just going back oh sorry there's a question in the room
2:02:41
you just triggered a question in my head here so um Sarah talked about the university that you have in cdia which I
2:02:47
think is you know really fundamental to build your skills yet I don't see a
2:02:53
budget allocation to that particular task is is there a budget associated with building that out
2:02:59
and where would it fit within the Lots so there isn't a a single specified
2:03:07
budget as such today you'll have noticed from the the last instructor Slide the expanded one that had um detail on it I
2:03:14
think there's about 15 million pounds allocated in total two lot five um which again is a forecast on what we
2:03:21
think we will spend but the way that spend is taken up is largely through commissioning by individual parts of the
2:03:28
cdio organization who will commission a particular Academy to suit their needs
2:03:34
so for example David Cooper is the primary user of Pega resources so David
2:03:40
May commission the creation of a Pega Academy on an ongoing basis and it makes
2:03:46
sense for us in some ways to almost industrialize that as a process so that as one
2:03:51
the next one comes through so that we have that constant throughput of Staff because we know we lose them out of the
2:03:56
door as quickly as we've trained them because we can't pay them enough but that industrialization of that
2:04:02
process means we'll get to retain more of them potentially just because they love us because we're fantastic people
2:04:07
to work but the the volume will start to shape
2:04:13
the market too over time as we have more and more skilled individuals in those in those areas
2:04:19
um so whilst I wouldn't say there's a fixed budget we're forecasting that there's about 15 million pounds that will be
2:04:25
allocated to the the technology skills academies and the production of the um
2:04:30
the 12-week cross training course as that would result in a nano degree so as our existing staff start to move away
2:04:37
from Legacy Technologies they can be trained on the Strategic technologies that are being introduced into the business
2:04:43
hopefully that answers it I think so of course uh did you want to
2:04:50
come in about to come in did you want to come in on that Sarah it's going to say I mean we we obviously
2:04:56
do a lot of work on a business as usual basis as well so this isn't just about
2:05:02
um you know creating capability or learning opportunities for new stuff but
2:05:07
this is about existing staff as well about really utilizing the talent that we already have in cdio because yes we
2:05:15
are a fantastic place to work and I think we're making it even better you know we've we've got a great learning
2:05:21
and career development offer now in cdio and it's really about building that out
2:05:26
so that um you know it is about then retaining more of our internal talent but also
2:05:33
really leverage in our talent as well I think we have Sarah thank you thank
2:05:39
you Sarah uh there's a question in the room oh hi it's uh Natalie Gray from
2:05:46
co-durance here I was just wondering more about the one-to-one sessions in Birmingham just wondering like how long
2:05:52
are they and do suppliers that have made the effort to come and see you in Birmingham get more points or yeah just
2:05:58
wondering how it works can I just um um follow on because we have a couple questions online related so you can take
2:06:04
them all together so um where there's a question about whether there's an agenda for the face-to-face and whether the
2:06:11
market engagement days are multi-supplier or individual supplier meetings so if you could take those
2:06:17
so the events will be individual one-to-one so each supplier will
2:06:22
individually be able to meet with a joint team from ccs and hmrc during those Market engagement sessions
2:06:29
there will be no points allocated to attending face-to-face I think we would struggle to get that one past the lawyers
2:06:35
um but the the opportunity that there will be no agenda because it's an opportunity for you as suppliers to have
2:06:41
digested everything that you've heard today reviewed the packs and come to us with any further questions that you
2:06:47
might have one of the things that we found throughout tsp is that some of these events have been naturally limited
2:06:54
I guess in the questions that have been asked and sometimes that's just about
2:06:59
um a bit of uncertainty as to how far to go with a question when you've got competitor organizations in the room
2:07:05
with you so having the opportunity to ask that in an anonymized setting where
2:07:10
nobody knows who's asked what question when it gets published we anticipated would give us greater opportunity to
2:07:17
have more open dialogue in terms of the timing we're planning to allocate 45 minutes to each supplier for those
2:07:23
face-to-face sessions does that cover all of the aspects of
2:07:30
I think so I great all right
2:07:36
let's see how are you thinking about content expertise versus Raw DDOT skills as you
2:07:43
award lots for example Customs borders requires specialist knowledge to build good services
2:07:51
um I guess that's probably one more for Jillian and Dean to perhaps take between
2:07:57
them foreign yeah someone can help with that so
2:08:02
we need people who understand the technologies that we're building in we need people with the skills
2:08:09
um for example and obviously is sort of Bas and that sort of thing and Technical
2:08:14
Architects the Customs knowledge because there are two sorts of technicals in our
2:08:20
world the Customs knowledge comes from our selves so we have a a pool what we call it a
2:08:26
large pool but a pool of subject matter experts we have a depth of knowledge inside cdio borders and trade so this is
2:08:34
what I really mean by it's that combination of internals and externals
2:08:39
um you know at the end of it I mean partners that we work with become subject matter experts in that narrow
2:08:46
field but we wouldn't expect you to come with deep knowledge of CPC code 2783 for
2:08:53
example okay that's not going to happen there only are a handful of people in the entire world
2:08:59
um well that we could have at access to does that help
2:09:05
I think so yes thanks Dean Jillian was there anything you would like to add there uh same as Dean from a digital
2:09:11
platform point of view I mean obviously we do more than just the borders and trade program we've got multiple
2:09:17
programs and platform team and again you know we've just transitioned from a number of suppliers still
2:09:23
um who didn't come in with deep hmrc knowledge but we have the intelligent client Leo within the digital platform
2:09:30
team who are the hmrc permanent staff as well as the subject matter experts from
2:09:35
the business that were with us in programs and projects that we deliver excellent and I think just to expand
2:09:42
that a little bit further because of the fact that this is going to be a cross-government framework it'll be up
2:09:47
to each department that uses the framework to Define for themselves where the boundary lies between what they want related to content and ddat
2:09:57
you have one down in the front
2:10:05
um what framework terms are going to be used for the contract framework Public Service public sector
2:10:11
contracts what they'd be based on right so the the framework itself is being developed from the
2:10:18
um the cabinet's office public sector I.T Services contract
2:10:24
um and it will be augmented with specific content based on the things
2:10:29
that we've discussed today now some things are at this moment open to discussion as to how they land and I
2:10:35
think Michael will be able to say a little bit more on that but so when we land it it'll be clear as to what
2:10:41
information sits at the framework level what sits within a department-specific
2:10:46
service specification and what sits within a a call off contract potentially even an enduring call-off contract for
2:10:53
the suppliers appointed that we can then start to commission statements of work from
2:10:58
I think we're getting into more of a you know horses for courses scenario within ccs and making sure that we have the
2:11:04
right contract for the right Lots so we are looking at that and making sure that we have the right terms with each to
2:11:11
support each of the types of activity that are going on so I'm not going to say now it's going to be one because
2:11:16
because it may be different types as we have in tier three um so just it will be what we think and
2:11:23
when we go through what will support the framework other customers and suppliers best
2:11:29
organizations it will be issued with the ITT with the Itt yeah they'll go out in the acting
2:11:36
not with the SQ no they'll go out with the Itt
2:11:42
which is normal thank you
2:11:49
another question going back to the cloud question for a minute so given that there's an expectation to broaden Beyond
2:11:55
AWS in azira what is hmrc's strategic and Technology posture on multi-cloud
2:12:05
so I think as Tom covered in his video uh the shift to the shift to a uh
2:12:11
platforms and services trying to consume them as services so particularly software as a service um and platform as
2:12:17
a service will will it inevitably mean that and and consuming them in a way you
2:12:23
know in a um working from that vend from the core product and only customizing as required
2:12:30
is will inevitably end up with uh multiple uh Solutions being provided
2:12:35
across that so so as Phil talked about we have we already have um infrastructure a lot of our
2:12:42
infrastructures on cloud services but as we adopt more more of a platform-based architecture that will will lead to the
2:12:48
adoption of more cloud services from different software providers thank you
2:12:55
as more departments join the framework will they all share the same time
2:13:01
or will each customer have their own so it will be for each customer to Define for themselves how what they want
2:13:08
to adopt in relation to that yes it would be a call of specific and how they
2:13:13
want to apply it or if they want to apply it it's not going to be dictated across the framework this could be a key
2:13:18
principle of the call up that hmrc are using and just to look back around on
2:13:23
that question about the framework because obviously there's some uncertainty there um we're running this as a restricted
2:13:30
process specifically because we wanted to release this in waves because if we release the entire thing to the markets
2:13:36
at once it will diminish the quality of what we are able to get back from the market so so consequently rather than
2:13:43
having to those who might be interested in um applying to be on five Lots at once you wouldn't want to stretch your A-Team
2:13:50
so thinly in such a short space of time but what that also enables us to do is
2:13:55
to release the specific elements of that wave at the time of the wave now when
2:14:00
the it the first ITT goes out um we will have details that cover the
2:14:05
entire framework from end to end and then the ITT for wave one will be
2:14:11
specific around the services that we'll be consuming in that wave and then similarly for wave two but the actual
2:14:17
the legal side of the documents the the contractual Vehicles the framework the call of contracts they will be released
2:14:24
as part of the ATT issuance for wave one
2:14:31
yeah we we couldn't do that on open and that's where we one of the reasons we
2:14:37
upped the touristry from codeurance and one of the themes uh
2:14:44
this morning has been about operating on outcomes based uh contracts and supplies
2:14:50
having skin in the game would those be don't understand correctly working on
2:14:55
fixed price terms so again there are a number of commercial models that we could use for
2:15:01
outcome-based contracts we're not necessarily tied to fixed price but um as well as fixed price you we could
2:15:07
have models that are based on part fixed and part variable velocity incentivization models or or return on
2:15:13
investment models so we plan as part of the hmrc specific elements of that to
2:15:18
provide information to the markets as to the types of commercial models we would be looking to use with the options then
2:15:24
available for us to put in place on a case-by-case basis just back up again back up to the
2:15:32
framework level we're going to give the customers the option to use whatever is right for the project and for them at
2:15:37
that point in time that they call off the work
2:15:44
any more in the room no okay uh I think we'll we'll just take maybe
2:15:51
one or two more questions uh maybe one from online once more to see if there's any in the room because they think we're
2:15:57
sort of getting close to time now um
2:16:02
I think which one shall I pick here how will you ensure that the sqs and ITT
2:16:08
don't unintentionally end up a bias on the score for large incumbent suppliers of hmrc
2:16:17
those who um participated in the processes that we followed under Tech sourcing program
2:16:23
Tech Services Program will remember the um the steps that we took to level the
2:16:30
playing field to the extent that actually um it was quite a a pleasant surprise to
2:16:37
see new suppliers enter the HMR hmrc stable so hopefully with that experience
2:16:44
it will be evident to the market that we're not specifically wedded to any
2:16:50
specific supplier um any specific incumbent also the fact that we have framework
2:16:57
Lots in which there are multiple opportunities to get onto the framework would in itself indicate that even if
2:17:04
incumbent suppliers were to be successful throughout the process it's not just going to be the incumbent
2:17:09
suppliers who are going to be on the lot and it's certainly not just incumbent suppliers that will be allocated work through that lot either on the taxi rank
2:17:17
basis or through through competition so wherever possible we'll be looking to to
2:17:22
level the playing field using those same mechanisms that we used in Tech sourcing program but one of the things that's important
2:17:28
to say as well because this is a framework and not a contract we can't go into the specifics of exactly what that
2:17:34
would mean when it comes to assessing transition costs and the 2p implications
2:17:40
because we just don't know what they are now where um we're procuring for a framework rather
2:17:46
than for a contract and when we start to put in place call-offs there will potentially be some of those call-offs
2:17:51
where there are 2p implications and transition cost implications and we will start to provide information on those on
2:17:57
a case-by-case basis but you could expect that it would follow the same sort of process that we've done in tsp
2:18:03
where transition cost wouldn't be taken into account as part of the um the scoring of the bid
2:18:10
and yes CCS running those and setting out the Esq and supporting the ITT
2:18:17
aspect we will take the bias out of that and look at trying to get that Level Playing Field response we have no
2:18:24
understanding of what's happening when we have an understanding but no detail around who the key suppliers are that
2:18:30
that they need to keep or want to keep we'll just pull that back um and use it and buy it so you
2:18:37
I think interestingly as well when we do the evaluations um the way we set up the evaluation
2:18:43
teams that are often represented of some different parts of the organization so where you might have a supplier that
2:18:50
could perhaps create some kind of unconscious bias for one evaluator in one part of the business about wanting
2:18:55
to keep them that would absolutely be leveled off by the fact that there are multiple evaluators from multiple parts
2:19:01
of the business you may have nothing to do with with that supplier so it's in
2:19:06
some ways it's it's self-policing but it's also moderated as well by the commercial team to ensure any traces of
2:19:12
bias are removed from the process however unconscious those traces of bias
2:19:18
may be
2:19:23
I will be able to answer the rest of the slider questions later on yes we're going to take those away and
2:19:29
we'll create a spreadsheet with answers to all the questions and put them on the CCS website along with the the
2:19:35
presentation deck I think I'll just take uh I'll take two
2:19:42
more because one of them has been asked three times and then another one I think is is a bit
2:19:48
more interesting so um when working remotely uh as just
2:19:53
mentioned would there be a need to do so at secret classification
2:19:59
I guess Julian and Dean may be able to provide a bit more information on this but generally not we don't do very much
2:20:06
at secret classification but there are odd occasions where we do have certain interfaces with mod and one or two other
2:20:13
organizations where that might happen but um yeah it would be definitely trailed and enough time given for
2:20:21
suppliers to be able to get the accreditations necessary to operate at that level but um I guess so that the
2:20:28
cross cross-government piece is exactly the same book level and the requirement of the
2:20:34
customer there as when needed Jillian or Dean did or Rich I agree Phil no I agree
2:20:41
um it would depend on the project if something came into that nature and we would give the supplier plenty of
2:20:47
warning that that was happening but that's not the norm for what we do certainly in the digital platform team
2:20:53
yeah or sensitive stuff we normally use as data isn't it really Jillian sorry didn't I cause across you then
2:21:00
yeah yeah it it is I mean there's occasional bits and pieces with us there's certainly some secret data there
2:21:07
are some secret um uh elements like risking
2:21:12
um you know of goods uh for obvious reasons but again it would be with prior
2:21:18
knowledge we wouldn't need the organization to be classified as that you know that we deal with it would be
2:21:23
an individual level we'd give a lot of um notice about that and there's not a lot
2:21:30
there is some but not a great deal foreign
2:21:36
thanks Dean I think I'll take a final question here
2:21:42
how much rating on prices will there be and how will pricing be scored in Itt
2:21:49
so to be finalized we're still working on my level of detail and we'll work out how what's
2:21:55
what's the importance of pricing uh across the pieces and work out how we can get the the best commercial value
2:22:02
into into the framework early on to help all of our customers get even better
2:22:07
commercial value going forward I mean just to expand on The hmrc View on that we we certainly have a
2:22:14
perspective that as Lee set out at the beginning um the capacity capability and
2:22:19
competition are more of the key features for us rather than price specifically
2:22:25
but clearly price is important and given the economic pressures that exist now we
2:22:30
understand that it's um it's going to be a challenge when bits are put in to maintain that competitiveness of pricing
2:22:37
for the headline rate cards that that get produced but uh we will be looking
2:22:42
to get the the highest quality solutions to uh to meet our needs at the the best
2:22:48
possible price whilst recognizing that the cheapest isn't always the best
2:22:55
great I'll just pause for any final from the room questions comments
2:23:02
no one bar left on the microphone so
2:23:08
okay great um you have promised there are more on slido that we I just just don't think we
2:23:14
have enough time to get to everything but you guys will review those questions and provide the answers so rest assured
2:23:20
that even if you didn't get to ask it or have it answered now they will be answered and addressed
2:23:26
um I just want to I guess take a little bit of time to say thank you oh lee it
2:23:32
looks like you're up to say thank you first
2:23:39
yeah so just to wrap up um I just want to say thanks to Tech UK first of all for hosting and
2:23:45
facilitating thank you for all of the speakers I hope you found that informative I've certainly learned some
2:23:52
things about Dallas and hmrc from the last couple of hours I hope you all did as well and and most of all thank you
2:23:58
all for attending both the people that have come in today as well as those online from all of the questions and
2:24:06
thanks so much for the people to answering those to show a lot of interest and to be honest we're wasting our time like we don't get a lot of
2:24:12
interest in this framework it's no good as suppliers don't want to be on it uh you've seen the next steps
2:24:18
there is opportunity we do not have the Monopoly on good ideas we have time between now and October to hear your
2:24:26
thoughts and feedback if you've got that there's a number of channels to reach out please take advantage of those
2:24:32
one-to-one sessions we've learned from TSP that sometimes these open forums uh
2:24:38
aren't always the best places to to get really good ideas so please if you're interested take up those one-to-one
2:24:45
sessions and um yeah thanks again for this uh I think we'll be hanging around for about the next half hour or so so if
2:24:52
anybody wants to say hello we will be here um and thanks again
2:25:00
foreign just the final word of thanks from me uh
2:25:08
for those who have joined us online and for those in the room and uh have a great day thank you
