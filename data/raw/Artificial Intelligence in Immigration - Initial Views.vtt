2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/29-0
00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:06.110
Sort of things you talked about
before. Then maybe just to so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/29-1
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.448
that set the scene a little bit.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-0
00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:12.007
Ohh yeah, I mean we we we we
talked about these automated

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-1
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.446
gates that would work on
biometrics kind of I don't know

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-2
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:19.127
five years ago pre COVID could
when they were introducing it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-3
00:00:19.127 --> 00:00:22.928
into Dubai Airport there was a
proof of concept going on so we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-4
00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:26.608
talked about them as talked
about that with them quite a lot

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-5
00:00:26.608 --> 00:00:29.686
we also talked about kind of
automated analysis of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-6
00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:33.426
documentation that they were
getting in beforehand to be able

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-7
00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:36.986
to help determine whether
somebody was you kind of legally

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/100-8
00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.038
or illegally or they were
faking.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/146-0
00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:44.008
Certain documentations we talked
about real time translation, as

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/146-1
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.157
Alan has said, but again what
the technology wasn't quite

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/146-2
00:00:48.157 --> 00:00:52.735
there to do that we talked about
pre interviewing people or the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/146-3
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:57.171
video calls which would have
automatic and real time language

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/146-4
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:00.748
translation. This is before
teams was introduced.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-0
00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:05.039
And so many of the things I
think we kind of talked about of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-1
00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.976
kind of being realised now or
haven't quite been realised. I'm

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-2
00:01:08.976 --> 00:01:12.850
not sure what happened at the
Dubai trial, but the technology

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-3
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.661
has moved on now to the extent
that many of the things might

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-4
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:19.848
actually be productised and
available. I think the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-5
00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:23.597
difference or the problem we
have is that none of it's been

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-6
00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:26.784
used in a context of this
importance. So real time

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-7
00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:30.345
translation, if teams got it
wrong, it doesn't matter so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/222-8
00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:30.658
much.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/240-0
00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:34.306
If it's in a a setting like
this, then it's more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/240-1
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:37.448
problematic, so I think we'd
have to look at the.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/251-0
00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:40.974
If efficacy of a lot of the
technology to the level that we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/251-1
00:01:40.974 --> 00:01:41.708
want there on.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/253-0
00:01:43.198 --> 00:01:43.478
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/256-0
00:01:44.488 --> 00:01:44.898
Angel.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/261-0
00:01:45.908 --> 00:01:47.308
But sorry, that was quick.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/290-0
00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:51.534
And when was it? When I was at
HP. So this is sort of five

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/290-1
00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:55.661
years ago. This was when HP
owned a autonomy, which is now

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/290-2
00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:59.718
not allowed to be referred to as
autonomy. It's now idle.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/282-0
00:01:56.508 --> 00:01:56.858
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/299-0
00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:03.638
Um, you know, it was doing
pretty some prep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/305-0
00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:06.198
Tease sophisticated real time.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/315-0
00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:10.528
And transcription. So for
example on the BBC.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/330-0
00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:14.568
When the subtitles coming up in
real time, that's all done. That

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/330-1
00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:15.398
was all done by.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/339-0
00:02:15.488 --> 00:02:19.188
And idol and also we used it
for.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/359-0
00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:23.963
And real time imagery and video
analysis. So it would do like

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/359-1
00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:28.583
scene capture and you could go
back to what you were saying,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/359-2
00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:29.568
Chris, about.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/391-0
00:02:30.248 --> 00:02:33.713
Yeah, I've just got this vision
of a couple of border guards

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/391-1
00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:37.292
saying ohh there's a wrong and
like back in the 50s again when

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/391-2
00:02:37.292 --> 00:02:40.871
when someone but they you can
spot changes in people's gait in

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/391-3
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.178
terms of how they walk.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-0
00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:46.597
And and could would would look
at it at spotting patterns of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-1
00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:50.837
where people were starting to
just congregate unnaturally so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-2
00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.451
that I know that's a technology
solution. You know,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-3
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:58.760
out-of-the-box. And like you
say, technology has moved on and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-4
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.860
move continues to move on, but
that's something we we used

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/439-5
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.598
successfully in the past.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/441-0
00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:05.428
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/453-0
00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:10.559
More in in the sort of national
security side rather than

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/453-1
00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:11.798
Homeland Security.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/467-0
00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:15.220
Um, but yeah, there's just
building on what what Lee was

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/467-1
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.908
saying about the transcriptions
side.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/493-0
00:03:19.328 --> 00:03:22.841
Gate analysis is good. You can
do gender and gender from gear

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/493-1
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.298
to analysis. Quite often you get
what you used to get people

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/490-0
00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:26.518
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/493-2
00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:27.658
coming in for different.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-0
00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:32.367
While with, with, with the
autonomy at the time we were

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-1
00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:36.766
using it to real index in real
time and ISIS propaganda videos,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-2
00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.890
so you'd have the, the, the, the
video and it will be going

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-3
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.221
through it, capturing there's a
face, it will be say, you know

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-4
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:49.757
there's a there's a young Arabic
male, there's a group, it's in a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-5
00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:54.157
desert scene. It was. So we're
doing a scene classifications it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/559-6
00:03:54.157 --> 00:03:55.188
could identify.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-0
00:03:56.318 --> 00:03:59.822
Weapons that could identify
vehicles could identify flags,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-1
00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:03.565
and it could lift the text off
the flags cause uh um, it would

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-2
00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:07.248
lift the text off flags. There
would be a WhatsApp symbol. It

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-3
00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:11.049
would capture the phone number
and it would capture all of that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-4
00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:14.970
in real time, and then index the
whole thing because historically

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-5
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.712
it used to be a manual process
and then you could then when it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-6
00:04:18.712 --> 00:04:22.276
was finished, just search for
specific things show, show me

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/636-7
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:26.078
all the scenes where there's a
vehicle or a weapon or whatever.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/646-0
00:04:26.168 --> 00:04:29.758
There is pretty pretty, pretty
neat even I have to say.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/691-0
00:04:32.428 --> 00:04:35.579
Wow. So but I think in a lot of
cases here with with the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/691-1
00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.730
immigration you you it's made
that there's things in the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/691-2
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.379
airport but there's probably the
biggest value is we've got a lot

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/691-3
00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.697
of standard documents coming
through and it's being able to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/691-4
00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:47.798
analyse those documents and look
for.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/733-0
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.928
You know things that are. So if
you if you have all the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/733-1
00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:55.284
decisions that have been made by
existing officials when they're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/733-2
00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:58.691
reviewing cases and you see what
the outcome is and then you you,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/733-3
00:04:58.691 --> 00:05:01.788
you put that through some sort
of AI or machine learning or

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/733-4
00:05:01.788 --> 00:05:04.008
something, surely you could
begin to spot.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-0
00:05:05.298 --> 00:05:08.133
You know, like a digital twin
version of the person who's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-1
00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:11.310
doing the assessment so well the
the digital person is actually,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-2
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.536
no, that looks dodgy to help you
just focus more on each case and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-3
00:05:14.536 --> 00:05:17.566
then eventually, once you got to
your, you're happy that it's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-4
00:05:17.566 --> 00:05:20.548
it's reaching it to the right
level. You could automate that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/785-5
00:05:20.548 --> 00:05:22.748
to a degree. There are risks
obviously, but.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/783-0
00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:22.038
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/789-0
00:05:23.368 --> 00:05:24.068
Yeah, I mean.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-0
00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:28.515
Sorry, I was just say cause I
over the years we've had

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-1
00:05:28.515 --> 00:05:32.503
conversations in the Home Office
is deliberately steered away

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-2
00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:36.683
from automated decision making.
But what we have been successful

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-3
00:05:36.683 --> 00:05:40.928
in was assisted decision making.
So again, when looking at asylum

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-4
00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:45.044
cases which are really complex,
providing the examiner with the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-5
00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:49.032
right prompts to assess the case
and then drafting the either

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-6
00:05:49.032 --> 00:05:53.148
rejection or acceptance letter
out the back of it because a lot

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/867-7
00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:55.078
of the appeals are overturned.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/901-0
00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:58.733
And technicalities. And that's
because caseworkers, you suggest

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/901-1
00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:02.029
free form the responses and so
lawyer and the lawyer worth

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/901-2
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:05.660
their salt would find some gaps.
So we automated that, but it it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/901-3
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.236
may be lasted a couple of couple
of years and they went off and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/901-4
00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.018
did their own.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/936-0
00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:14.317
Thing I think that's cause it
was a bespoke technology, but

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/936-1
00:06:14.317 --> 00:06:17.826
that doesn't mean that the
problem hasn't hasn't gone away.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/936-2
00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:21.276
But I I think it depends based
on your conversations where

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/936-3
00:06:21.276 --> 00:06:24.668
there's a real appetite for
change and automated decision

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/936-4
00:06:24.668 --> 00:06:25.078
making.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/956-0
00:06:28.298 --> 00:06:31.048
Because, bluntly, the civil
servants are employed there. If

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/956-1
00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:33.523
you automate their roles,
they've gotta go somewhere,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/956-2
00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:33.798
right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/960-0
00:06:34.468 --> 00:06:34.978
Yep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/966-0
00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:37.078
And that's that's always been
the argument.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/993-0
00:06:40.308 --> 00:06:44.016
I've got lots of hands up here,
so to let's try with the. I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/974-0
00:06:40.638 --> 00:06:41.088
But if.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/993-1
00:06:44.016 --> 00:06:47.478
can't see you as first though,
so I'll win there we go.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/990-0
00:06:45.258 --> 00:06:46.538
Owen always first.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1025-0
00:06:47.718 --> 00:06:51.266
I was just going to build on
media's point right so gently

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1025-1
00:06:51.266 --> 00:06:55.055
VAI is the big thing now, right?
So using Gentry for I to give

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1025-2
00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:58.724
each immigration officer their
own body which will help them

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1025-3
00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:00.228
accelerate, you know and.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-0
00:07:00.308 --> 00:07:04.305
Yeah, like an expert virtual
assistant building allowance

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-1
00:07:04.305 --> 00:07:08.786
point. You know where you train
the LM? The large language model

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-2
00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:12.577
on policies, procedures,
previous use cases, decisions

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-3
00:07:12.577 --> 00:07:16.230
caught, you know, context,
whatever you want, right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-4
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.572
Doesn't matter. And then each
immigration officer would have a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-5
00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:24.570
buddy and then the the outcome
would be accelerated. Case

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1078-6
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.638
reviews. Right on cases. Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-0
00:07:27.538 --> 00:07:31.358
Um, so we we've got a method,
you know which we've our in our

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-1
00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:35.117
in our generative are offering
the best three things yeah so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-2
00:07:35.117 --> 00:07:38.815
one conduct workshops to help
identify use cases. So we can

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-3
00:07:38.815 --> 00:07:42.266
offer that we could do a
generative AI workshop for you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-4
00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:45.717
know for the Home Office and say
hey let's work on this

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1127-5
00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:48.798
immigration problem and we have
to pick you know.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1133-0
00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:51.218
Where we want to do it right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-0
00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:55.695
I yeah. The gate or, you know,
use cases or asylum or whatever

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-1
00:07:55.695 --> 00:07:58.821
the case may be, you know,
whatever the domain may be. And

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-2
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.894
the second thing is to take the
prioritised use cases and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-3
00:08:01.894 --> 00:08:05.285
concept them so that you know,
we can figure out how to make it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-4
00:08:05.285 --> 00:08:08.516
stick. And the third one is to
help them implement. But, you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-5
00:08:08.516 --> 00:08:11.165
know, we could start with the
first just use case

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-6
00:08:11.165 --> 00:08:14.556
identification and the value of
delivering the use case. Right.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-7
00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:18.053
What is the outcome? What is the
increased increased productivity

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1212-8
00:08:18.053 --> 00:08:20.808
efficiency as a result of
delivering that use case?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1226-0
00:08:25.068 --> 00:08:27.180
It's really helpful any any
comments on that point from

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1226-1
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.538
album before we move on to
another?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-0
00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:33.242
Or just just one and I sort of
put it in the chat like

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-1
00:08:33.242 --> 00:08:36.677
caseworking is is super
efficient. So we've done a huge

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-2
00:08:36.677 --> 00:08:40.113
amount over the years to
basically get all of the later

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-3
00:08:40.113 --> 00:08:44.101
ready for a case worker to make
a decision. It used to take ages

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-4
00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:48.027
because they had to wade through
different bits of information.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-5
00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:51.647
It doesn't follow a linear
process, but literally now on a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-6
00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:55.144
case worker makes a decision,
but they make a couple 100

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-7
00:08:55.144 --> 00:08:58.825
decisions a day in the overseas
business mainly for kind of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1295-8
00:08:58.825 --> 00:08:59.868
visit or sort of.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1324-0
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.273
Study study visas. So it's I
think it's super super

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1324-1
00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:07.418
efficient. I guess what we need
to do is work out where we wanna

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1324-2
00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:11.308
bike tackle it. So when you look
at the end to end chain of.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1329-0
00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:14.158
Um, you know, applying for a
visa.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1375-0
00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:18.060
All the way through to leaving
the country. Where are those

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1375-1
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.318
points of intervention? Cause
it's a it's a massively complex

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1375-2
00:09:21.318 --> 00:09:24.208
non linear process, but I don't
I know we've mentioned

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1375-3
00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:27.413
caseworking a few times. I don't
think that's where the Home

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1356-0
00:09:24.228 --> 00:09:24.618
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1375-4
00:09:27.413 --> 00:09:29.358
Office would see their problems
are.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1419-0
00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:33.722
That's exactly the point I was
gonna raise, Alan. It feels to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1419-1
00:09:33.722 --> 00:09:37.259
me from this conversation that
is not as much at the, quote,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1419-2
00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:40.970
unquote, point of intervention.
I the guy comes and and there's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1419-3
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.565
a conversation about the case.
He it's more about what can we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1419-4
00:09:44.565 --> 00:09:47.058
do in the pre and potentially in
the post.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-0
00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:52.561
And how we can use artificial
intelligence in that sense, so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-1
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:57.150
generative I always was given an
example. For instance, during

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-2
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:01.812
the process of evaluating that
know asylum requests or whatever

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-3
00:10:01.812 --> 00:10:06.255
a study visa or whatever. But
also how can we use Ghai 3 for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-4
00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:10.626
instance, to provide better
information, easier information

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-5
00:10:10.626 --> 00:10:15.288
for people to apply or to review
some of the documentation that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1476-6
00:10:15.288 --> 00:10:16.818
needs to be prepared.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1484-0
00:10:16.938 --> 00:10:20.088
So that there is also a an
earlier view.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-0
00:10:20.758 --> 00:10:25.003
Right from an on office
perspective or those potential

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-1
00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:30.019
applicants. So there's a I think
if you look at it, user journey

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-2
00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:35.036
right of the various cases kind
of look at the pre and the post,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-3
00:10:35.036 --> 00:10:39.744
I think it's where the most
value can actually be added. And

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-4
00:10:39.744 --> 00:10:44.297
also there's less risk of bias.
Cause I was following very

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-5
00:10:44.297 --> 00:10:49.005
attentively your your preamble
Chris. And although those are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1549-6
00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:50.858
dynamics that do happen.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-0
00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:55.524
Right. I think there's a huge
risk in terms of introducing

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-1
00:10:55.524 --> 00:10:59.954
bias of reinforcing bias in the
intervention time, right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-2
00:10:59.954 --> 00:11:04.002
Whereas if we focus our
attention on the pre and the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-3
00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:08.814
post exactly album, I just saw
your comment exactly those type

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-4
00:11:08.814 --> 00:11:13.092
of things, checking forms, all
of these things that can

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1608-0
00:11:13.058 --> 00:11:13.308
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1615-5
00:11:13.092 --> 00:11:15.918
actually save a huge amount of
time.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1623-0
00:11:17.418 --> 00:11:21.588
And and actually have an
effective impact.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1634-0
00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:24.988
For the for the caseworkers and
the Home Office in general.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1655-0
00:11:27.348 --> 00:11:29.625
So you say pre just so I
understand is it look but so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1655-1
00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.818
you'd submit it in and then
they'll do some initial

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1655-2
00:11:31.818 --> 00:11:33.758
validation before it then goes
to someone to.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1669-0
00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:37.768
To do a proper assessment is
that what you're saying? Ohh

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1681-0
00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:40.745
Yes, yes and yes. And there
might be cases where people need

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1669-1
00:11:37.768 --> 00:11:38.018
yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1681-1
00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:42.398
to pre submit information.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1717-0
00:11:43.638 --> 00:11:46.936
Right for the cases, I mean, I
remember I was when I when I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1717-1
00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:50.400
moved to Canada right, there was
a lot of documentation that I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1717-2
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.423
had to exchange before I even
presented myself for the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1717-3
00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.018
airport. For instance, right.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1726-0
00:11:55.828 --> 00:11:58.248
So all all of these sort of
things.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1757-0
00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:03.502
Is the the pre mobile and the
post is probably the I will call

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1757-1
00:12:03.502 --> 00:12:07.573
it the exit or the follow up to
a particular event that has

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1757-2
00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:10.558
happened during the evaluation
of the case.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1761-0
00:12:11.478 --> 00:12:12.468
In the UK.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1791-0
00:12:13.728 --> 00:12:17.495
All of the applications these
days you send the documentation

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1791-1
00:12:17.495 --> 00:12:21.322
at the same time and it's all
pretty much moving to electronic

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1791-2
00:12:21.322 --> 00:12:25.211
format it for some applications.
The applicants then have to go

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1791-3
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:25.758
to enrol.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1811-0
00:12:26.588 --> 00:12:31.240
Ah, you need to get your facial
recognition and identification

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1811-1
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.596
taken in a in an enrollment
centre which are primarily run

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1811-2
00:12:35.596 --> 00:12:35.818
by.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1820-0
00:12:36.638 --> 00:12:39.358
Ohh Soprasteria on behalf of the
Home Office.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1832-0
00:12:42.688 --> 00:12:46.104
Yeah, and that's a classic area
where a I got plaintive

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1832-1
00:12:46.104 --> 00:12:46.898
applications.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1841-0
00:12:53.538 --> 00:12:56.678
K anymore comments on on Gen
Luca's point?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1860-0
00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:00.855
I can't see the card so many
hands up and and I'm not

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1860-1
00:13:00.855 --> 00:13:03.698
recording the order of them. So
who is next you remember?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1853-0
00:13:01.138 --> 00:13:01.358
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1880-0
00:13:03.598 --> 00:13:06.718
That it? Yeah, it's me. If you
click on people, Chris, it has,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1880-1
00:13:06.718 --> 00:13:09.839
it has a listener of everybody
with their number next to them.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1871-0
00:13:07.018 --> 00:13:07.708
Alright Sir.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1880-2
00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:11.078
So you can see who's who.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1908-0
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:17.411
So you can see the order. Sorry.
I'm gonna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1908-1
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:21.550
mention a filthy subject now in
case working and it begins with

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1908-2
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:23.878
C and it's the the corruption
word.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1954-0
00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:28.972
And I at this may all be ironed
out now in, with, with, with

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1954-1
00:13:28.972 --> 00:13:33.469
Atlas. But about 10 years ago I
did a project in the security

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1954-2
00:13:33.469 --> 00:13:37.459
and corruption unit in the Home
Office where there was

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1954-3
00:13:37.459 --> 00:13:41.956
significant or rife corruption
in amongst caseworkers, within

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1954-4
00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:45.438
immigration, who the at the
time, the accepted.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1983-0
00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:50.132
Yeah. For another six months, it
was five grand. If you wanted

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1983-1
00:13:50.132 --> 00:13:54.173
indefinite leave to remain, it
was 10 grand and there were a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1983-2
00:13:54.173 --> 00:13:58.149
lot of caseworkers taking bribes
in order to put put people

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/1983-3
00:13:58.149 --> 00:13:59.408
through, therefore.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2016-0
00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:04.464
Well, so maybe have that the
back of our mind. So if we're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2016-1
00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:08.167
looking at cases on bulk in
order to train models, be

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2016-2
00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:11.048
cognizant of the fact that some
of those.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2040-0
00:14:12.758 --> 00:14:16.686
Permission to kind of come into
the country may not necessarily

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2040-1
00:14:16.686 --> 00:14:20.676
be based on on the right kind of
decision in more bribes anyway.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2040-2
00:14:20.676 --> 00:14:23.868
I don't know whether that's
still an issue anymore.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2046-0
00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:27.728
I guess I'd say extreme bias.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-0
00:14:29.358 --> 00:14:32.167
You you could actually do it. I
mean it's point you actually do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2055-0
00:14:30.378 --> 00:14:30.688
It's.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-1
00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:34.757
it the other way around, right
where you could do an order

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-2
00:14:34.757 --> 00:14:37.566
review of cases. And then if the
you know if the if the digital

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2072-0
00:14:35.938 --> 00:14:36.448
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-3
00:14:37.566 --> 00:14:40.156
twin kind of says well, I
wouldn't have wanted this and it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-4
00:14:40.156 --> 00:14:42.834
does that five times in a row
for the same person they maybe

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2095-0
00:14:42.778 --> 00:14:43.118
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2100-5
00:14:42.834 --> 00:14:43.888
you take a look at that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2099-0
00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:44.918
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2108-0
00:14:44.688 --> 00:14:48.038
And rather than kind of the
other way around.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2126-0
00:14:49.748 --> 00:14:52.955
Yes, this would I wonder whether
it's it's once like a QA point,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2126-1
00:14:52.955 --> 00:14:55.916
isn't it? Whether you could
train it to look for suspicious

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2126-2
00:14:55.916 --> 00:14:56.508
patterns in.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2144-0
00:14:57.238 --> 00:15:00.047
Authorization rather than
actually making the decision

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2144-1
00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:02.448
itself, is just a pinpointing
ones for review.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2143-0
00:15:02.678 --> 00:15:02.968
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2177-0
00:15:03.378 --> 00:15:06.874
We we did cat. We did capture a
person and they had a brand new

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2177-1
00:15:06.874 --> 00:15:10.317
Jaguar. It was a Jaguar XJ at
the time, had a brand new Jaguar

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2177-2
00:15:10.317 --> 00:15:13.158
XJ and the last three letters on
their Reg was SLY.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2179-0
00:15:19.768 --> 00:15:20.128
Wow.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2192-0
00:15:21.598 --> 00:15:23.980
You thought that deliberately
put that on there. Ohh well

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2185-0
00:15:21.798 --> 00:15:22.238
But.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2192-1
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:24.268
anyone.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2195-0
00:15:24.848 --> 00:15:25.518
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2194-0
00:15:25.128 --> 00:15:25.438
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2197-0
00:15:27.148 --> 00:15:27.438
Alan.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2206-0
00:15:30.808 --> 00:15:32.938
Is it Lee or is it me or don't?
I can't remember.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2213-0
00:15:34.778 --> 00:15:36.628
It will see you now it's leave
but gone.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-0
00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:40.064
Ohh what was it? OK I was. I was
gonna say like this. Like, this

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-1
00:15:40.064 --> 00:15:43.800
is a wide really wide-ranging
subject. Like I don't know if

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-2
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.660
this is helping or making it
worse for you Chris. But I think

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-3
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.706
like we can offer expertise in a
number of areas but it's how do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2250-0
00:15:49.938 --> 00:15:50.138
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-4
00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:55.566
we how do we sort of zone that
down does does the client want

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2266-0
00:15:54.928 --> 00:15:55.998
Is effective.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-5
00:15:55.566 --> 00:15:59.177
like a primer or do we just
would it be helpful if we set

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-6
00:15:59.177 --> 00:16:02.788
out here's the end to end
journey from start to leave and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2300-7
00:16:02.788 --> 00:16:06.088
here are some things we can talk
about in each area.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2287-0
00:16:03.148 --> 00:16:03.378
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2295-0
00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:04.978
I think.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2304-0
00:16:06.258 --> 00:16:07.628
But I'm not.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2324-0
00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:09.854
I think it would be better to do
the latter like you said, so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2324-1
00:16:09.854 --> 00:16:13.373
just go through the process and
just say where potentially there

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2324-2
00:16:13.373 --> 00:16:16.188
could be more value for AI
compared to other areas.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2328-0
00:16:17.058 --> 00:16:17.998
I think that would be helpful.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2370-0
00:16:18.668 --> 00:16:21.931
Yeah, and do and do we know in
this room where other countries

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2370-1
00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:25.142
are applying a I cause the home
off the Home Office will know

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2370-2
00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:28.456
that sort of stuff, cause they
were talking to, like, countries

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2370-3
00:16:28.456 --> 00:16:31.098
around the world about what was
what was going on.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2372-0
00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:32.308
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2378-0
00:16:33.688 --> 00:16:35.748
And some of the adoption
challenges, OK.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2396-0
00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:39.337
So I think now is an interesting
time because the the previous

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2396-1
00:16:39.337 --> 00:16:41.648
challenge was the data data was
all over the place.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2398-0
00:16:42.028 --> 00:16:42.308
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-0
00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:46.120
But, but I think it's it's
trying to understand what

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-1
00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.869
they're trying to do. They
trying to look for operational

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-2
00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:51.617
efficiency. They're trying to
look for cost savings. They

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-3
00:16:51.617 --> 00:16:54.651
trying to get more people into
the country. They trying to stop

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-4
00:16:54.651 --> 00:16:57.731
fraud. Are they trying to stop,
you know, terrorism and all that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2441-5
00:16:57.731 --> 00:16:59.438
sort of stuff or is it all of
them?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-0
00:17:00.188 --> 00:17:02.593
I think it's all of them. So
it's just it was a generic

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2446-0
00:17:00.378 --> 00:17:00.768
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-1
00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:05.299
request down from the Cabinet
Office saying how can you in the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-2
00:17:05.299 --> 00:17:08.091
Home Office use AI and they went
toward different departments on

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-3
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:10.540
this. So it's it's just
completely it's just the flavour

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-4
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.117
of the month as you can imagine
because obviously it's very

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-5
00:17:13.117 --> 00:17:15.780
exciting at the moment. But it
was a wide-ranging request. So

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2495-6
00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.358
that's why I think if you just
went through the end to end.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2511-0
00:17:20.378 --> 00:17:22.954
I said that would be a good way
of of of logging it down. I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2511-1
00:17:22.954 --> 00:17:25.058
think so. Today's been doing it
as it generally.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2534-0
00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:33.939
To have just put a an article in
in the chat that gives a few use

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2534-1
00:17:33.939 --> 00:17:38.233
cases of foreign immigration,
what it's being used, including

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2534-2
00:17:38.233 --> 00:17:39.618
work done in the US.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2573-0
00:17:42.128 --> 00:17:45.278
Excellent. Thank you, okay.
We'll just do lie and then Medi

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2573-1
00:17:45.278 --> 00:17:48.428
and then we'll start to go
through the process. But I I did

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2573-2
00:17:48.428 --> 00:17:51.683
a terrible explanation as to
what the end to end process was.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2573-3
00:17:51.683 --> 00:17:54.518
Is there anyone that would be a
good, good person to?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2570-0
00:17:52.748 --> 00:17:53.178
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2597-0
00:17:55.468 --> 00:17:58.356
I mean, obviously you guys been
working there for God knows how

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2584-0
00:17:55.738 --> 00:17:56.608
I'm talking about me.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2590-0
00:17:57.628 --> 00:17:58.018
Probably.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2597-1
00:17:58.356 --> 00:18:00.658
long. So Ian, would you be able
to do that or not?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2594-0
00:17:59.088 --> 00:17:59.458
Have.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2622-0
00:18:01.338 --> 00:18:04.659
I'm just trying to recall my
it's been what? Because it I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2622-1
00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:08.153
mean it does sit in in chunks,
isn't it as it apply, travel,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2622-2
00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:11.418
live exit. I can't remember the
full kind of big blocks.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2626-0
00:18:12.328 --> 00:18:12.718
Yep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2627-0
00:18:12.378 --> 00:18:12.908
Others.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2631-0
00:18:13.578 --> 00:18:14.648
A kind of help.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2659-0
00:18:15.268 --> 00:18:18.721
And yeah, I mean we can kind of
I I have got a journey map

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2659-1
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.409
somewhere probably on the call
like you give me two minutes. I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2659-2
00:18:22.409 --> 00:18:23.638
see if I can find it.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2665-0
00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:26.228
Yeah, if you can do that, we
really helpful okay over to Lee.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-0
00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:29.462
Yep. So a couple different
things. I guess things are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-1
00:18:29.462 --> 00:18:32.213
occurring to me as we talked
them in the first one for me is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-2
00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:34.918
you know we always get this
question. What can I do for me?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-3
00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:37.804
What can machine learning do for
me etcetera? And is we have to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-4
00:18:37.804 --> 00:18:40.735
look take that question and kind
of throw it away to some extent

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-5
00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:43.620
where your problems right, which
we've already started to cover

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2711-0
00:18:42.218 --> 00:18:42.518
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-6
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.596
what the process is. But even if
you understand the process, what

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-7
00:18:46.596 --> 00:18:49.257
is the problem? Where are your
current blockers, where the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-8
00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:51.691
issues that you're having
problems overcoming because

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-9
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:54.397
that's when you can look at it
to see what the solution is,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-10
00:18:54.397 --> 00:18:56.922
right? So it's the business
problem where you can apply

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2762-11
00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:57.418
technology.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-0
00:18:57.518 --> 00:19:00.468
So we may be AI, maybe something
else, but that's the best way to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-1
00:19:00.468 --> 00:19:03.329
do this rather than just spoke
to go different things. But some

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-2
00:19:03.329 --> 00:19:06.234
of the things we kind of came up
with when we looked about these

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-3
00:19:06.234 --> 00:19:08.871
last time was firstly ought to
determination this was more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-4
00:19:08.871 --> 00:19:11.374
about kind of people crossing
both small boats crossing

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-5
00:19:11.374 --> 00:19:13.788
actually. But you could
determine where the influx of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-6
00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:16.559
travellers was gonna come from
based on the news and based on

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-7
00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:19.197
what was happening, you know
something in Sudan now you're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-8
00:19:19.197 --> 00:19:21.968
going to get a huge number of
refugees from there. Are people

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-9
00:19:21.968 --> 00:19:24.784
going to be trying to come into
the country from that and that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-10
00:19:24.784 --> 00:19:27.645
can help you schedule and people
in place specifically for that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2853-11
00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:27.958
region.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2871-0
00:19:28.048 --> 00:19:30.956
So you can help you determine
where you need to kind of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2871-1
00:19:30.956 --> 00:19:33.398
forward load and other things I
guess as well.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-0
00:19:33.858 --> 00:19:36.689
And when they were doing in
person interviews, there's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-1
00:19:36.689 --> 00:19:40.035
something verse of accent versus
language. So people would claim

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-2
00:19:40.035 --> 00:19:42.764
to come from a particular
region, but be speaking in

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-3
00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:45.955
different accent and you can
automatically determine that now

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-4
00:19:45.955 --> 00:19:49.096
and that can help you find fraud
in those application forms,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-5
00:19:49.096 --> 00:19:52.442
sentiment analysis, even in real
time or of the letters. And the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-6
00:19:52.442 --> 00:19:55.582
written documentation that they
provide, do they support the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-7
00:19:55.582 --> 00:19:58.413
words that are being written
because the sentiment are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-8
00:19:58.413 --> 00:20:01.760
written with is often different
with what they're trying to say.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2954-9
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.128
And again, that can help you
determine fraud.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2981-0
00:20:04.588 --> 00:20:09.115
And then reviews of the written
documentation for commonality.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2981-1
00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:13.642
So quite often there was this
process of professionals writing

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/2981-2
00:20:13.642 --> 00:20:16.158
the application forms and now
you.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3018-0
00:20:27.668 --> 00:20:27.968
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-0
00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:31.459
Actually, helping genuine people
get across the across the border

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-1
00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:34.475
was actually trying to stop
fraud, which is why the Bogra

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-2
00:20:34.475 --> 00:20:37.803
theme. But there's lots of those
types of little use cases that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-3
00:20:37.803 --> 00:20:40.922
can be done. And at the time we
were thinking about kind of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-4
00:20:40.922 --> 00:20:44.146
having to develop some of these
things that have been done in

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-5
00:20:44.146 --> 00:20:47.422
proof of concept. Now I think
they would be relatively easy to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3070-6
00:20:47.422 --> 00:20:48.098
put together.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3080-0
00:20:49.578 --> 00:20:52.338
Through kind of native, it's
through stock products.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3088-0
00:20:54.048 --> 00:20:56.978
That's really helpful, Lee.
Thank you very much. And medi.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-0
00:20:59.278 --> 00:21:03.107
So I think it largely a I and I
think this has been alluded to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-1
00:21:03.107 --> 00:21:06.572
by a few people on this call a I
couldn't help of course

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-2
00:21:06.572 --> 00:21:10.341
anywhere. But there is also the
the situation that we need to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-3
00:21:10.341 --> 00:21:14.232
consider both the ethics and the
impact of the work that's done

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-4
00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:18.001
not only that about the quality
of the inputs which will then

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-5
00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:21.830
impact things such as bias and
also quality of outputs because

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-6
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.599
**** in **** out ultimately,
which we need to make sure isn't

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-7
00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:29.490
going to happen in places such
as the Home Office where it's so

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3169-8
00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:30.098
important.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-0
00:21:30.468 --> 00:21:34.748
I think also when we get that
stage that the process is stage,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-1
00:21:34.748 --> 00:21:38.824
we want to decide how much
impact you'd have with a I. So a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-2
00:21:38.824 --> 00:21:42.629
point of intervention, it
probably would be minimal for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-3
00:21:42.629 --> 00:21:46.773
the Home Office in terms of the
return on the investment for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-4
00:21:46.773 --> 00:21:50.170
building such a complex
borderline infallibles it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-5
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:53.975
solution that has to be versus
to build a generative AI

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-6
00:21:53.975 --> 00:21:58.187
solution that manages to churn
out all of their documentation

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3242-7
00:21:58.187 --> 00:22:00.158
in seconds rather than hours.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-0
00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:04.480
And then that gives you a cost
improvement, which then helps to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-1
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.456
justify the cost of these
things. It also improves the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-2
00:22:07.456 --> 00:22:10.864
adoption quality of it because
it means that you're not taking

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-3
00:22:10.864 --> 00:22:14.165
out some huge risky project and
product which they're paying

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-4
00:22:14.165 --> 00:22:17.735
through the nose for rather than
actually just building something

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-5
00:22:17.735 --> 00:22:21.198
that is an efficiency gain. And
then the more of those you get,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-6
00:22:21.198 --> 00:22:24.552
then you've got soft adoption of
AI and then they become more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-7
00:22:24.552 --> 00:22:28.015
comfortable with it and you're
able to then do the bigger, more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-8
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:30.936
complex programmes. It's also
deciding on the type of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3331-9
00:22:30.936 --> 00:22:32.668
technologies they'd want to use.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3360-0
00:22:32.748 --> 00:22:38.565
And on top of that, it need we
on this call need to be aware of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3360-1
00:22:38.565 --> 00:22:42.746
the impact of our
recommendations as well for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3360-2
00:22:42.746 --> 00:22:47.018
something so potentially risky
for us as well.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3381-0
00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:52.374
Um, I decided to in the in the
message we don't want to become

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3381-1
00:22:52.374 --> 00:22:57.219
the consultancy that then is on
the front page of the Daily Mail

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3381-2
00:22:57.219 --> 00:22:57.518
for.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3387-0
00:22:58.288 --> 00:23:00.848
Racial profiling by an app so.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3399-0
00:23:01.658 --> 00:23:04.398
That's really important that we
need to consider how we do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3399-1
00:23:04.398 --> 00:23:05.188
things like that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3425-0
00:23:05.488 --> 00:23:09.466
And something we're doing in the
AI capability is considering the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3425-1
00:23:09.466 --> 00:23:13.204
ethics of the work that we do in
AI as well. So we need to be

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3445-0
00:23:12.148 --> 00:23:16.438
Perhaps you are aware of IBM
stopped all work on facial

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3425-2
00:23:13.204 --> 00:23:14.048
categorically.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3445-1
00:23:16.438 --> 00:23:21.188
recognition, for instance to to
stop at at route any bias so.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3469-0
00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:26.024
And we know that officers that
would be training these models

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3469-1
00:23:26.024 --> 00:23:28.459
whilst they have gone through
bias training, there is still an

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3469-2
00:23:28.459 --> 00:23:30.778
inherent bias that happens. And
so if we do that via a bot.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3483-0
00:23:34.258 --> 00:23:37.456
It could happen. Yeah. Noted.
OK. So, I mean, at this stage,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3483-1
00:23:37.456 --> 00:23:38.348
we're just gonna.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-0
00:23:39.198 --> 00:23:41.942
The idea was just come up with a
a short sublist on, maybe even

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-1
00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:44.687
just e-mail, so nothing quickly
formed as the these are sort of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-2
00:23:44.687 --> 00:23:47.346
areas that we we think would be
interesting to look in AI and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-3
00:23:47.346 --> 00:23:49.747
potential benefits but but
obviously if they were gonna

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-4
00:23:49.747 --> 00:23:52.492
implement any of this they need
to do it properly with a proper

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3539-5
00:23:52.492 --> 00:23:54.508
assessment and understand the
risks around it.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3540-0
00:23:55.398 --> 00:23:55.828
I'm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3554-0
00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:00.209
But yeah, point taken. Okay.
Ian, have you managed to find

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3554-1
00:24:00.209 --> 00:24:02.008
the the, the, The Amazing
graphic?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3561-0
00:24:04.158 --> 00:24:05.868
I have.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3563-0
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:06.798
And we yeah, hey.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3572-0
00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:08.998
So it was from.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3576-0
00:24:08.128 --> 00:24:10.328
Ohh man that's that brings back
memories.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3595-0
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:13.870
I don't know, it's a graph. I
don't know. It's the latest

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3595-1
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:16.283
version, but it will give us an
anchor to form. Yeah, not

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3595-2
00:24:16.283 --> 00:24:17.448
certainly have a discussion.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3613-0
00:24:19.248 --> 00:24:21.739
The probably let this is quite a
few years old, but the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3613-1
00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:23.518
principal's surely cannot have
changed.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3615-0
00:24:25.178 --> 00:24:25.358
That.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3618-0
00:24:26.238 --> 00:24:26.758
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3643-0
00:24:27.708 --> 00:24:30.684
I mean it's fairly
self-explanatory, said learn is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3643-1
00:24:30.684 --> 00:24:34.243
just people considering about
what? Why what they need to do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3643-2
00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:37.628
to come to the UK, apply with
the various types of visas.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3645-0
00:24:38.468 --> 00:24:38.858
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3649-0
00:24:39.858 --> 00:24:41.158
Working travel.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3651-0
00:24:42.118 --> 00:24:42.948
Arrive.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3653-0
00:24:43.738 --> 00:24:44.128
Oops.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3683-0
00:24:45.588 --> 00:24:48.656
Yeah, at least stay might be
changing circumstances whilst

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3683-1
00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:51.621
they're here. Leave. And then
the the the guest. There's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3683-2
00:24:51.621 --> 00:24:54.377
there's a caveat. Anytime
throughout that process of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3683-3
00:24:54.377 --> 00:24:55.678
stuff. So does that more.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3697-0
00:24:57.608 --> 00:25:01.484
I guess we can annotate the the
opportunities against that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3687-0
00:24:57.888 --> 00:24:58.218
J.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3697-1
00:25:01.484 --> 00:25:01.878
model.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3700-0
00:25:02.678 --> 00:25:02.948
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-0
00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:06.135
Sorry buddy, was given folks
some context as to what some of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-1
00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:09.250
them mean and you might need to
help me out and Ned with my

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-2
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.262
memory of this stuff. I think
this is probably one of the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3732-0
00:25:11.218 --> 00:25:11.388
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-3
00:25:12.262 --> 00:25:15.377
diagrams that I contributed to
back in the day that they're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3737-0
00:25:12.768 --> 00:25:13.458
But you said it.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-4
00:25:15.377 --> 00:25:18.700
probably 2 routes of migration
in the Home Office. There's like

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-5
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.607
regular migration and then
there's irregular migration,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3761-0
00:25:21.188 --> 00:25:21.448
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-6
00:25:21.607 --> 00:25:24.775
which is asylum effectively, and
the asylum stuff is not not

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-7
00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:27.994
shown here cause that's sort of
unpredictable. The UK is what

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3775-0
00:25:25.978 --> 00:25:26.418
Yeah, yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-8
00:25:27.994 --> 00:25:31.213
they're trying to do is follow a
model similar to the US with

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3795-9
00:25:31.213 --> 00:25:33.238
lighters and permission to
travel. So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-0
00:25:33.308 --> 00:25:36.839
Effectively what we're trying to
do is stop people that don't

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3804-0
00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:35.098
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-1
00:25:36.839 --> 00:25:40.428
have the right to travel or come
to this country. For me, even

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-2
00:25:40.428 --> 00:25:43.846
boarding a plane and in time
boat or train so they won't be

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-3
00:25:43.846 --> 00:25:47.206
able to actually physically
travel here, which is what the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-4
00:25:47.206 --> 00:25:50.567
universal permission to travel
work is. That's ongoing. So

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3842-5
00:25:50.567 --> 00:25:52.618
that's that's the like policy
goal.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-0
00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:57.221
And the learning phase is all
about what what type of visa do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-1
00:25:57.221 --> 00:26:00.547
I need? I'm coming to study,
work, visit and those

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-2
00:26:00.547 --> 00:26:04.460
regulations are constantly
shifting. The apply phase is the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-3
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.047
online application journey,
which is increasingly more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-4
00:26:08.047 --> 00:26:11.504
digital now. So the EU
settlement scheme was a first

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-5
00:26:11.504 --> 00:26:15.026
example of where we're using
people sort of biometric

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-6
00:26:15.026 --> 00:26:18.743
passports and pushing out what
would have been biometric

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-7
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:22.395
capture out to the user. So
normally when you apply for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3909-8
00:26:22.395 --> 00:26:23.048
biometric.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-0
00:26:23.118 --> 00:26:26.341
Is you have to go to a visa
enrollment centre. We're trying

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-1
00:26:26.341 --> 00:26:29.563
to do is push it so that you can
do it all from your mobile

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-2
00:26:29.563 --> 00:26:32.625
device. So if you've got a
biometric passport, you could

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-3
00:26:32.625 --> 00:26:35.579
use NFC to like scan your
passport. You capture like a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-4
00:26:35.579 --> 00:26:38.749
facial images. So anyone that
signed up for a digital bank

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-5
00:26:38.749 --> 00:26:41.649
account will know, like the
liveness tests. So that's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-6
00:26:41.649 --> 00:26:45.194
basically the application models
of the future. So trying to stop

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/3973-7
00:26:45.194 --> 00:26:47.558
people going to these
applications centres.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4008-0
00:26:48.038 --> 00:26:51.897
And then the the travel phase is
is, as I said, you turn up to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4008-1
00:26:51.897 --> 00:26:55.634
the airport where you've got,
you know, book is about making

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4008-2
00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:59.248
sure you've all permissions.
Then you book your travel and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4008-3
00:26:59.248 --> 00:27:02.618
then that's checked before you
depart when you arrive.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-0
00:27:03.078 --> 00:27:06.576
And the journey is very much as
think Ian articulated or Chris

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-1
00:27:06.576 --> 00:27:10.130
you articulated is we just kind
of walk through the border, say

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-2
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.184
you kind of just walk, walk
through the gates and they

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-3
00:27:13.184 --> 00:27:16.571
automatically open cause they
know who you are. But actually

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-4
00:27:16.571 --> 00:27:19.902
like knowing who is on the
flights and what intelligence we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-5
00:27:19.902 --> 00:27:23.512
have about them and what threats
they have. So when we worked on

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-6
00:27:23.512 --> 00:27:26.566
the borders case, Chris, like,
there's still gathering

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-7
00:27:26.566 --> 00:27:29.842
information about people that
have booked a flight but not

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4085-8
00:27:29.842 --> 00:27:33.118
travelled, those that have
actually turned up to the gate.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-0
00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:36.263
You're not got on the plane
versus he's actually on the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-1
00:27:36.263 --> 00:27:39.482
plane. So there are multiple
drops of information that all

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-2
00:27:39.482 --> 00:27:42.919
get pushed to the Home Office as
part of that journey and they

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-3
00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:45.919
run all their watch list
cheques. So in advance, which

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-4
00:27:45.919 --> 00:27:49.193
they'll stop people boarding a
plane. But some of it, we've

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-5
00:27:49.193 --> 00:27:52.466
done more people are travelling
and there will also be some

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-6
00:27:52.466 --> 00:27:55.958
people that we may want to let
into the country because we then

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-7
00:27:55.958 --> 00:27:59.395
arrest them when they get when
they get here. But knowing that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-8
00:27:59.395 --> 00:28:02.777
they're coming is a huge amount
of intelligence and there's a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4164-9
00:28:02.777 --> 00:28:05.778
huge amount of watch listing
that goes on in the back.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-0
00:28:05.878 --> 00:28:09.928
And that's, you know, obviously
sort of data intensive and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-1
00:28:09.928 --> 00:28:14.116
highly sort of analytical, I
don't know to what extent we're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-2
00:28:14.116 --> 00:28:18.029
looking at a I tools in that
space already certainly for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-3
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:22.423
freight and cargo. There's the
Cerberus platform, which is what

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-4
00:28:22.423 --> 00:28:26.748
we use for proactive targeting
and that's kind of in the space

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4207-5
00:28:26.748 --> 00:28:27.778
that Nigel and.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-0
00:28:28.448 --> 00:28:31.968
Totally clear operating in in
DSA and then when people are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-1
00:28:31.968 --> 00:28:35.428
here and which is sort of the
stay part, that's very much

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-2
00:28:35.428 --> 00:28:39.246
about checking that they've got
in the right entitlements to do

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-3
00:28:39.246 --> 00:28:42.886
things. So the status contract
that we've just won tells you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-4
00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:46.227
whether you've got the right to
work the right to claim

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-5
00:28:46.227 --> 00:28:49.627
benefits. And normally when
you're in that phase, people

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-6
00:28:49.627 --> 00:28:53.326
then tend to potentially abscond
or disappear if they want to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-7
00:28:53.326 --> 00:28:56.846
kind of claim asylum. So that's
where they've got into the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4282-8
00:28:56.846 --> 00:28:58.338
country or maybe a visit.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4290-0
00:28:58.418 --> 00:29:00.548
These are and then they just
disappear and never.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-0
00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:04.862
Never return the change bit is
about updating your permission.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-1
00:29:04.862 --> 00:29:08.458
So say you've come here as a
student and you want to now stay

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-2
00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:11.938
for a. You've graduated and you
now want to work here. Your

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-3
00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:15.245
circumstances have changed and
you need to kind of get a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-4
00:29:15.245 --> 00:29:18.725
permanent visa and then the
leave stage is. Obviously we've

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-5
00:29:18.725 --> 00:29:22.379
known that you've arrived. We're
now gonna count the fact that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-6
00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:26.091
you've left. So counting in and
counting out the numbers should

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-7
00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:29.804
proudly equal the same. And then
there's a whole bunch of stuff

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4359-8
00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:32.008
that you can do at any point in
that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4386-0
00:29:32.238 --> 00:29:35.831
That journey process, such as
update your details so there's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4386-1
00:29:35.831 --> 00:29:39.070
quite a lot of like data
intensive operations that run

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4386-2
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:42.663
throughout all of that. And and
I think they've we've really

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4386-3
00:29:42.663 --> 00:29:44.548
tried to minimise the amount of.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4421-0
00:29:45.858 --> 00:29:48.676
Human interaction and touch
points, so a lot of the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4421-1
00:29:48.676 --> 00:29:51.711
caseworking and decisioning that
sort of happens in the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4421-2
00:29:51.711 --> 00:29:55.180
background is is largely kind of
automated. And what we've done

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4421-3
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.649
for the caseworkers is give them
everything they need to make a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4421-4
00:29:58.649 --> 00:30:00.058
straight forward decision.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4423-0
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:01.468
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4433-0
00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:05.794
But I still think there are
areas for improvement and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4433-1
00:30:05.794 --> 00:30:06.558
enhancement.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4438-0
00:30:07.408 --> 00:30:09.878
In in that process basically.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4439-0
00:30:10.468 --> 00:30:10.778
Sweet.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4456-0
00:30:10.958 --> 00:30:14.058
Three, start on the left, then
on the learn. So do you think

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4456-1
00:30:14.058 --> 00:30:17.108
there's anything there where
there's a currently a problem?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4458-0
00:30:18.668 --> 00:30:19.108
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4498-0
00:30:20.158 --> 00:30:23.485
So I'm not sure how
sophisticated, so if I if I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4498-1
00:30:23.485 --> 00:30:27.782
literally what I've been doing
this, I've been trying to work

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4498-2
00:30:27.782 --> 00:30:32.080
out whether I can send Ella D
from my team to Cyprus for some

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4498-3
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.239
MD work and it's taking about 5
minutes to wait through the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4498-4
00:30:36.239 --> 00:30:37.348
gov.uk guidance.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4506-0
00:30:38.388 --> 00:30:41.009
Whereas if I could just type a
natural language question and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4506-1
00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:41.138
go.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4522-0
00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:46.003
Can can can can I send the other
day to Cyprus for a meeting for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4522-1
00:30:46.003 --> 00:30:46.828
for two days?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4532-0
00:30:47.818 --> 00:30:50.809
And it would be nice to get like
a authority, you know, an answer

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4532-1
00:30:50.809 --> 00:30:51.398
back on that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4534-0
00:30:52.498 --> 00:30:52.898
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4552-0
00:30:53.878 --> 00:30:56.480
It's exactly the same when
people try to apply to come to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4552-1
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.218
the UK, but unless you're an
immigration expert, sometimes I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4552-2
00:30:59.218 --> 00:31:00.968
language is a little bit
impenetrable.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4565-0
00:31:02.618 --> 00:31:06.046
You know, I I I'm going
somewhere to do something. Now

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4565-1
00:31:06.046 --> 00:31:07.168
tell me if that's.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4573-0
00:31:07.838 --> 00:31:09.988
Permissible or what I need to
have in place for that?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4576-0
00:31:12.128 --> 00:31:12.468
Lee.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4577-0
00:31:12.488 --> 00:31:12.978
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4582-0
00:31:13.468 --> 00:31:14.368
But it's helped.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4601-0
00:31:13.808 --> 00:31:16.676
Yeah. So I think these things
are good. Idea is just one of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4601-1
00:31:16.676 --> 00:31:19.545
the things that it's just come
back to my memory when we we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4601-2
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.458
talked about similar things
previously.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4613-0
00:31:21.858 --> 00:31:25.154
Um, a skewed the active kind of
said to us, giving too much

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4613-1
00:31:25.154 --> 00:31:26.308
information up front.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4619-0
00:31:27.468 --> 00:31:29.448
Helps people work around the
system.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4623-0
00:31:30.438 --> 00:31:31.638
So it's just kind of work.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4639-0
00:31:31.718 --> 00:31:35.988
Yeah, with keeping that in in
the back of your head, when we

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4639-1
00:31:35.988 --> 00:31:39.138
look to provide information pre
application.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4648-0
00:31:41.438 --> 00:31:43.763
Yeah, well, this is about
finding out what they need to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4648-1
00:31:43.763 --> 00:31:44.178
apply for.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4671-0
00:31:44.628 --> 00:31:47.131
Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm sorry. You
say it's not necessarily

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4657-0
00:31:46.048 --> 00:31:46.338
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4671-1
00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:49.993
directly related. It's just come
in the back of my head. That's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4667-0
00:31:48.588 --> 00:31:49.008
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4671-2
00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:50.798
what we were told.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4673-0
00:31:51.868 --> 00:31:52.118
Yep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4720-0
00:31:55.008 --> 00:31:57.980
Are there people that that are
there like agents that people go

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4720-1
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.720
to that help them do this
application and give them advice

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4720-2
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.135
on this cause? Are you?
Basically you could replace

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4709-0
00:32:01.268 --> 00:32:03.658
Yeah, and immigration advisors.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4700-0
00:32:01.978 --> 00:32:02.298
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4720-3
00:32:03.135 --> 00:32:05.829
them. Yeah. Immigration. So
therefore you could in theory

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4720-4
00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:06.758
replace them with a.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4733-0
00:32:08.128 --> 00:32:11.797
But why? What I guess what value
is that to Home Office? I mean

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4733-1
00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:13.058
that that they almost.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4732-0
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:12.978
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4751-0
00:32:13.758 --> 00:32:16.629
Situation. I mean that's a nice
to have, I guess what's the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4751-1
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:18.448
motivation for some of us to do
that?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4747-0
00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:17.388
Well.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4791-0
00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:22.247
Yeah. What? What? What? The Home
Office really wants is the kind

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4755-0
00:32:18.838 --> 00:32:19.298
I.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4791-1
00:32:22.247 --> 00:32:25.717
of the tier Tier 2 and Tier 4
visa holders to come. They're

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4791-2
00:32:25.717 --> 00:32:28.841
the people that are gonna
targeted that drive kind of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4783-0
00:32:28.018 --> 00:32:28.188
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4791-3
00:32:28.841 --> 00:32:31.328
prosperity and and investment
into the UK.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4794-0
00:32:33.338 --> 00:32:33.888
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4811-0
00:32:35.658 --> 00:32:38.613
What's a facilitating at making
it easier for them to apply and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4800-0
00:32:35.718 --> 00:32:36.138
That's.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4811-1
00:32:38.613 --> 00:32:39.168
and cheaper?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4821-0
00:32:40.018 --> 00:32:43.358
Yeah, I mean I I I think I mean,
I think it's it's not.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4850-0
00:32:43.998 --> 00:32:47.986
It's not like they're biggest
problem area at the moment, but

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4850-1
00:32:47.986 --> 00:32:52.039
I guess I'm just using it as a
as a point more generally about

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4850-2
00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:55.770
immigration guidance that is
published on gov.uk can be a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4850-3
00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:56.478
little bit.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4852-0
00:32:57.348 --> 00:32:58.098
Confusing.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4854-0
00:33:00.538 --> 00:33:01.008
Say.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4856-0
00:33:02.198 --> 00:33:02.578
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4860-0
00:33:04.858 --> 00:33:05.258
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-0
00:33:04.908 --> 00:33:08.147
You're not. It strikes me that
it's quite hard to come up with

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-1
00:33:08.147 --> 00:33:11.490
a solution without knowing what
the pain point is, right? If you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4876-0
00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:09.128
Yeah. So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4886-0
00:33:10.858 --> 00:33:11.128
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-2
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.524
mapped all of the pain points
against this value chain and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-3
00:33:14.524 --> 00:33:17.712
against each paint point, say
what I call the moment of value

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-4
00:33:17.712 --> 00:33:21.055
is, right? So if the paint point
was eliminated, what value will

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-5
00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:23.832
be delivered, right? Either time
saved or efficiency?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-6
00:33:23.832 --> 00:33:26.968
Productivity cost, whatever the
moment of value is, then you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-7
00:33:26.968 --> 00:33:30.208
could actually go through each
of the pain point and say, hey,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-8
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:33.294
you know what, this could be
solved with AI or not here. Or

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4952-9
00:33:33.294 --> 00:33:34.888
your Group A group, some paint.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4971-0
00:33:34.958 --> 00:33:37.875
Points together cause you can
see the whole value chain end to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4971-1
00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:40.838
end and you could say this could
be solved with. Yeah you know.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/4966-0
00:33:38.298 --> 00:33:38.478
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-0
00:33:42.478 --> 00:33:45.541
And that will give us, uh, you
know, one to one correlation

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-1
00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:48.604
between the solution where
proposing and a pain point and a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-2
00:33:48.604 --> 00:33:51.668
moment of value. Right. And if
you group all the moments of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-3
00:33:51.668 --> 00:33:54.884
value, then you have an overall
figure of the, you know, value

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-4
00:33:54.884 --> 00:33:57.897
that will be delivered by
incorporating AI, which could be

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5021-5
00:33:57.897 --> 00:33:59.888
quite good headline executive
message.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5046-0
00:34:02.928 --> 00:34:05.132
Started. Don't think we
necessarily have that pain point

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5029-0
00:34:04.508 --> 00:34:04.658
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5046-1
00:34:05.132 --> 00:34:07.453
of view, do we at the moment
would be nice to have that the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5035-0
00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:05.798
Ohh my.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5046-2
00:34:07.453 --> 00:34:09.078
start that call, but I don't
think we do.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5056-0
00:34:10.378 --> 00:34:12.368
I'm not sure there is that pain
point view yet.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5097-0
00:34:12.158 --> 00:34:15.405
I think I think, yeah. I mean I
think it exists like you, you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5062-0
00:34:13.358 --> 00:34:13.828
Where is the.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5097-1
00:34:15.405 --> 00:34:18.757
need to speak to like if Simon
bonder on the call and you said,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5097-2
00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:21.794
Simon, where where are the
biggest problems in the end to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5097-3
00:34:21.794 --> 00:34:24.884
end process at the moment it
list off a couple of things I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5097-4
00:34:24.884 --> 00:34:25.618
don't imagine.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5099-0
00:34:25.998 --> 00:34:26.278
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-0
00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:30.146
And and and and. Do you think
that that's more like coming

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-1
00:34:30.146 --> 00:34:34.085
from an IT perspective? I mean
those thinking some more, more

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-2
00:34:34.085 --> 00:34:38.024
more thinking from a business
perspective, but yeah, exactly.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5128-0
00:34:35.188 --> 00:34:36.088
Business, OK.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-3
00:34:38.024 --> 00:34:41.518
So I I think yeah that that
there needs to be like a a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-4
00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:45.584
version of what what do you once
showing now needs to be passed

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-5
00:34:45.584 --> 00:34:49.396
through them and say please can
we spend you know two hours

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-6
00:34:49.396 --> 00:34:53.335
identifying these pain points
and that we can get back with a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-7
00:34:53.335 --> 00:34:56.512
with a more reasoned view
because the examples of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5182-8
00:34:56.512 --> 00:34:57.338
applications.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5218-0
00:34:57.538 --> 00:35:02.259
Endless like if you look just a
quick search, you see every

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5218-1
00:35:02.259 --> 00:35:07.373
counter has been experimenting.
I think the EU spent almost half

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5218-2
00:35:07.373 --> 00:35:11.779
a billion euros in a I
application and borders, so it's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5218-3
00:35:11.779 --> 00:35:13.668
not as much what can AI.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5239-0
00:35:14.718 --> 00:35:18.448
Do for you is more again like
the good consultants. What's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5239-1
00:35:18.448 --> 00:35:21.988
your problem? What is the
problem that you're trying to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5239-2
00:35:21.988 --> 00:35:22.368
solve?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5257-0
00:35:23.088 --> 00:35:27.904
And then what can potentially I,
amongst other things, to do to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5257-1
00:35:27.904 --> 00:35:30.538
help and support and create
value?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5259-0
00:35:31.678 --> 00:35:31.928
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5296-0
00:35:33.348 --> 00:35:36.753
Okay. Well I'm. I can. I can
pull together some of the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5266-0
00:35:33.678 --> 00:35:34.028
I mean.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5296-1
00:35:36.753 --> 00:35:40.715
seniors in, in the Home Office
to do that, to get their view on

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5296-2
00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:44.430
it and and and use that as a
feed with, you know, with some

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5296-3
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:47.278
input from us. So I'm happy to
organise that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5309-0
00:35:48.498 --> 00:35:51.478
Miss winning tonight and I cat
Callum's not on the cool, is he?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5308-0
00:35:50.818 --> 00:35:51.168
In.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5312-0
00:35:52.508 --> 00:35:52.928
No.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5313-0
00:35:52.568 --> 00:35:53.018
I.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5323-0
00:35:53.928 --> 00:35:56.848
In almost all aspects of Home
Office work.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5347-0
00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:02.244
Uh, whether it's front end pre
application during caseworking

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5347-1
00:36:02.244 --> 00:36:06.310
process or even post
application, every single issue

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5347-2
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.538
is data related.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-0
00:36:08.638 --> 00:36:13.842
And it's all because of missing
attributes or how different

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-1
00:36:13.842 --> 00:36:18.526
countries can enter their
application at the point of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-2
00:36:18.526 --> 00:36:24.077
entry and then how Home Office
handles that piece of data as it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-3
00:36:24.077 --> 00:36:29.281
flows through zillion different
systems. So the biggest the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-4
00:36:29.281 --> 00:36:34.572
biggest impact we could make is
automate the data correction

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5399-5
00:36:34.572 --> 00:36:37.868
order identification of invalid
data.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5429-0
00:36:38.788 --> 00:36:42.976
And potentially fixing it every
single programme, every single

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5429-1
00:36:42.976 --> 00:36:46.966
project is currently running
zillions of manual workarounds

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5429-2
00:36:46.966 --> 00:36:50.556
and scripts. There is like
little gremlins everywhere

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5429-3
00:36:50.556 --> 00:36:53.748
around the system to help make
data flows work.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5456-0
00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:58.455
For example, we just thought in
status project and they have a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5456-1
00:36:58.455 --> 00:37:01.796
swimlane called optimization.
All that Slimane is doing is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5456-2
00:37:01.796 --> 00:37:04.458
they're looking at data and
fixing attributes.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5458-0
00:37:04.938 --> 00:37:05.428
Uh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-0
00:37:06.738 --> 00:37:09.963
So can I think one of the
biggest things we could do is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-1
00:37:09.963 --> 00:37:13.591
how can we automate this? Could
this be a massive a I exercise

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-2
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:17.277
now? This isn't simple because
these attributes will have to be

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-3
00:37:17.277 --> 00:37:20.963
programmed and you know how many
countries in the world. That's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-4
00:37:20.963 --> 00:37:24.188
how many application processes
Home Office has and then

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-5
00:37:24.188 --> 00:37:27.701
whatever you country they have
about 15 different policy for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5524-6
00:37:27.701 --> 00:37:30.408
every policy there is a
different application.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5522-0
00:37:29.498 --> 00:37:29.708
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5526-0
00:37:31.268 --> 00:37:31.598
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-0
00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:36.573
Well, I mean that that that's
right cause I mean the key the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-1
00:37:36.573 --> 00:37:40.167
key to making all of the same
office stuff work has always

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-2
00:37:40.167 --> 00:37:44.126
been validating that the person
that you're dealing with is the,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-3
00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:47.355
you know, is actually the
person. So the identity of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-4
00:37:47.355 --> 00:37:50.948
someone and then their status
right, with those two things

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-5
00:37:50.948 --> 00:37:54.847
like locked together, you can do
like a huge amount of stuff to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5579-6
00:37:54.847 --> 00:37:56.918
take friction out of the
process.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-0
00:37:57.798 --> 00:38:02.011
And but but it says Ned said
there's like a lot of complexity

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-1
00:38:02.011 --> 00:38:06.360
in getting to those two points
like someone's status is is held

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-2
00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.505
across a number of systems and
is complicated by policy. And

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-3
00:38:10.505 --> 00:38:14.922
when policy is changed over the
time, you know, moving between a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-4
00:38:14.922 --> 00:38:18.999
year and not EU and and other
stuff in the history. So when

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-5
00:38:18.999 --> 00:38:23.349
you've got those sort fragmented
records like that's what a lot

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-6
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:27.086
of the caseworking process is,
is confirming someone's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5644-7
00:38:27.086 --> 00:38:27.698
identity.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5669-0
00:38:28.258 --> 00:38:32.049
And then assigning that person's
identity a status, which means

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5669-1
00:38:32.049 --> 00:38:35.781
like you're here as a visitor
and you have to leave within 180

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5669-2
00:38:35.781 --> 00:38:36.078
days.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5673-0
00:38:36.778 --> 00:38:37.678
For 90 days.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-0
00:38:40.668 --> 00:38:44.438
So like which is handy cause
that's like one of those

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-1
00:38:44.438 --> 00:38:48.768
projects is what we've just won
and we're trying to trying to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-2
00:38:48.768 --> 00:38:53.097
trying to address it, but that's
the that's the that's always

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-3
00:38:53.097 --> 00:38:57.635
been the cornerstone of when we
drew the first diagram this back

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-4
00:38:57.635 --> 00:39:02.034
in what 2014 it was always about
identity and status and we've

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5724-5
00:39:02.034 --> 00:39:04.758
always used biometrics in the
past to.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5738-0
00:39:05.638 --> 00:39:10.896
To confirm that identity for non
you know for non non visa

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5738-1
00:39:10.896 --> 00:39:11.788
nationals.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5758-0
00:39:14.448 --> 00:39:17.724
From these nationals? Yeah.
Safer by biometric visas and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5758-1
00:39:17.724 --> 00:39:20.598
residency permits. And all of
that sort of stuff.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5792-0
00:39:21.878 --> 00:39:26.617
And technologies change to allow
us to do that more and digitally

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5792-1
00:39:26.617 --> 00:39:30.782
now, but we still need to
capture fingerprints and things

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5792-2
00:39:30.782 --> 00:39:35.234
like that. But I think that's,
you know again technology will

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5792-3
00:39:35.234 --> 00:39:38.178
catch up with that and make that
viable.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5829-0
00:39:41.778 --> 00:39:45.189
But it is coming to Nan's point
though is is can you use? Can

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5829-1
00:39:45.189 --> 00:39:48.765
you use AI in anyway to validate
data or to spot things that are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5829-2
00:39:48.765 --> 00:39:52.231
wrong earlier in the process so
that you don't have to have to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5829-3
00:39:52.231 --> 00:39:55.752
correct it or what you work out
what's going on or have an idea

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5826-0
00:39:55.228 --> 00:39:55.688
Yes.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5829-4
00:39:55.752 --> 00:39:56.688
what it could be.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5860-0
00:39:56.998 --> 00:40:00.434
Yeah, we did it. We did a data
cleanup project. Alec Clark,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5833-0
00:39:57.368 --> 00:39:57.588
I.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5860-1
00:40:00.434 --> 00:40:03.986
Alex Clarke led. Didn't he? Like
there's loads of things that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5860-2
00:40:03.986 --> 00:40:07.308
like there's the basic stuff
that we identified. I'd know

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5860-3
00:40:07.308 --> 00:40:07.938
dates like.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5871-0
00:40:09.468 --> 00:40:12.208
Dates and errors, but yeah, I
think there's.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5879-0
00:40:13.748 --> 00:40:16.018
That there's a work work
underway on that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5881-0
00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:17.208
But.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5888-0
00:40:18.008 --> 00:40:20.318
But it's more of the pedestrian
type.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5892-0
00:40:21.028 --> 00:40:22.318
Clean up activities.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5894-0
00:40:25.978 --> 00:40:26.428
Sorry.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5906-0
00:40:28.208 --> 00:40:30.750
But I think, Ned, you were
talking about kind of helping

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5906-1
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:31.598
fill in the blanks.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5928-0
00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:35.993
Too much. I mean, if you if you
think like Deloitte fills the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5928-1
00:40:35.993 --> 00:40:39.718
front end application forms for
every case, where can system

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5928-2
00:40:39.718 --> 00:40:40.878
legacy and and new?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5945-0
00:40:41.558 --> 00:40:46.070
So if they launch an application
form that doesn't require a date

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5945-1
00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:48.668
of birth, the system will allow
that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5958-0
00:40:50.188 --> 00:40:53.415
And then when the application
gets to case working, nobody has

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5958-1
00:40:53.415 --> 00:40:54.338
a clue what to do.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5964-0
00:40:55.038 --> 00:40:56.828
It's a piece of missing data.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5991-0
00:40:59.158 --> 00:41:03.118
How do you collect these things?
Ohh if somebody misspells Vienna

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5991-1
00:41:03.118 --> 00:41:06.958
there is about in every European
language it's a different name

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5991-2
00:41:06.958 --> 00:41:07.798
for that city.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5993-0
00:41:08.808 --> 00:41:09.278
Uh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5995-0
00:41:10.418 --> 00:41:10.798
Uh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/5997-0
00:41:11.348 --> 00:41:11.508
The.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6018-0
00:41:14.588 --> 00:41:17.852
So you're saying have more of
the, you know, did you mean this

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6018-1
00:41:17.852 --> 00:41:19.458
type thing coming up with this?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-0
00:41:18.778 --> 00:41:23.367
Well, it it could be that it in
many cases it could be automatic

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6021-0
00:41:19.268 --> 00:41:20.678
Yeah, I I guess.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-1
00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:27.673
correction because you can match
the IP match the submission

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-2
00:41:27.673 --> 00:41:31.698
match or all kinds of stuff. I
mean we we create so many

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-3
00:41:31.698 --> 00:41:36.216
scripts like we have a L3 team
that team pretty much writes for

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-4
00:41:36.216 --> 00:41:40.805
example on Friday mastic deleted
the table by mistake and caused

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6073-5
00:41:40.805 --> 00:41:43.418
over 20,000 applications to go
able.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6087-0
00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:47.001
And they couldn't fix it. So
they they called us and leave

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6087-1
00:41:47.001 --> 00:41:49.338
her to all weekend fixing their
their Pradesh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6119-0
00:41:50.718 --> 00:41:54.719
And but that was a data fix, not
a simple it's it's. It's the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6098-0
00:41:53.428 --> 00:41:53.688
Hold on.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6119-1
00:41:54.719 --> 00:41:58.849
kind of stuff that in theory, a
I could automatically repair if

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6119-2
00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:02.656
something like this happens. I
mean, this was human caused

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6119-3
00:42:02.656 --> 00:42:03.108
terror.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6123-0
00:42:03.818 --> 00:42:05.298
By support teams.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6125-0
00:42:06.318 --> 00:42:06.658
A.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6133-0
00:42:08.138 --> 00:42:10.508
But we write scripts like this
all the time.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6146-0
00:42:12.228 --> 00:42:16.528
So AI could be told to do that
without having to be asked.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6162-0
00:42:19.998 --> 00:42:23.454
I mean, I guess what would be
interesting to hear is like

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6162-1
00:42:23.454 --> 00:42:25.958
where where people are using
kind of a I.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6182-0
00:42:26.948 --> 00:42:31.708
Type techniques in managing and
cleaning and maintaining large

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6176-0
00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.358
It's quality.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6182-1
00:42:31.708 --> 00:42:34.278
volumes of data and data
quality.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6196-0
00:42:35.388 --> 00:42:38.091
Because that's that's always
been the number one problem the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6196-1
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:38.978
Home Office has had.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6217-0
00:42:39.698 --> 00:42:43.103
Like you can't. You can't act on
some of the decisions until you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6202-0
00:42:39.928 --> 00:42:40.158
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6217-1
00:42:43.103 --> 00:42:44.518
know you've got solid data.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-0
00:42:45.898 --> 00:42:49.438
True. And if you think they're
challenges, they have a main

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-1
00:42:49.438 --> 00:42:52.801
database called CSDP, that's the
master and then that is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-2
00:42:52.801 --> 00:42:56.282
replicated for status. There's a
database that then stores

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-3
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:59.527
status, which is kind of a
subset of that data in some

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-4
00:42:59.527 --> 00:43:03.244
additional attributes. And then
for internal MI, they have the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-5
00:43:03.244 --> 00:43:07.020
same database applicated again
with some additional attributes.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-6
00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.443
So we have the same data set in
three different versions,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-7
00:43:10.443 --> 00:43:14.160
potentially more versions with
each version having potentially

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6290-8
00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.458
misaligned attributes.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6295-0
00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:18.068
That's a big data.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6301-0
00:43:18.818 --> 00:43:19.428
Problem.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6319-0
00:43:20.048 --> 00:43:23.077
Do you know if they have a tool
like elation for data governance

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6319-1
00:43:23.077 --> 00:43:25.408
and data visibility and to see
duplicate records?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6338-0
00:43:24.058 --> 00:43:28.526
Yeah, I'm here. I'm sure they
have governance for data longer

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6338-1
00:43:28.526 --> 00:43:30.688
than any book leave ever read.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6357-0
00:43:30.818 --> 00:43:34.238
No, no. Two or two. I'd like an
AI based 2 called elation. Yeah,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6339-0
00:43:31.128 --> 00:43:31.328
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6357-1
00:43:34.238 --> 00:43:36.448
something like that. Which
allows you to.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6356-0
00:43:35.318 --> 00:43:36.128
No, I.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6373-0
00:43:36.838 --> 00:43:39.555
I don't think they've got any
tools that sort of sit on top of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6373-1
00:43:39.555 --> 00:43:40.288
the the platform.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6378-0
00:43:40.408 --> 00:43:41.718
You could explain more about it,
Alan.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6376-0
00:43:40.888 --> 00:43:41.158
80.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-0
00:43:42.278 --> 00:43:45.446
Yeah. I'm gonna put a link into
the chat. Yeah, that will. So

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-1
00:43:45.446 --> 00:43:48.410
basically you put a tool like
elation and what it does it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-2
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:51.118
immediately puts out a spider
web and then it it, it

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-3
00:43:51.118 --> 00:43:54.184
identifies all of your data
sources, identifies duplicates,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-4
00:43:54.184 --> 00:43:57.404
identifies bad data, identifies
where prompts might occur, and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6425-5
00:43:57.404 --> 00:44:00.368
then gives you the kind of
capability to go fix it. Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6447-0
00:44:01.548 --> 00:44:04.754
Um, I'll put a link here. You
know that usually is like the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6437-0
00:44:03.998 --> 00:44:04.488
I mean.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6447-1
00:44:04.754 --> 00:44:08.068
first step of, you know, getting
grips with your data, right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6468-0
00:44:10.128 --> 00:44:13.890
Don't forget this database is
huge. It's possibly the one of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6468-1
00:44:13.890 --> 00:44:17.098
the largest data WS databases
that exists on Earth.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6479-0
00:44:18.428 --> 00:44:20.468
In terms of volumes, we did not.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6498-0
00:44:18.658 --> 00:44:23.628
No, no, it's not that. No, no,
it's it's it's only a few

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6481-0
00:44:20.528 --> 00:44:20.818
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6498-1
00:44:23.628 --> 00:44:28.598
billion billion records, but
it's not, it's not massive.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-0
00:44:30.438 --> 00:44:34.231
The the the issue is always been
fragmentation, so the data used

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6503-0
00:44:30.998 --> 00:44:31.358
You know.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-1
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:37.966
to exist in multiple systems, so
you had a separate system that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-2
00:44:37.966 --> 00:44:41.059
looked for in country
applications a separate system

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-3
00:44:41.059 --> 00:44:44.327
that looks for overseas
applications. A separate system

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-4
00:44:44.327 --> 00:44:47.653
that looked for student
applications and then there were

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-5
00:44:47.653 --> 00:44:51.155
all pulled into one application
through about five years of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6547-0
00:44:48.718 --> 00:44:49.108
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-6
00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:54.189
legacy running and
decommissioning and then the new

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-7
00:44:54.189 --> 00:44:57.749
systems have been built on top
of that where as they're just

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6573-8
00:44:57.749 --> 00:44:58.158
saying.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6616-0
00:44:58.988 --> 00:45:02.232
I delete state, change some of
the attributes that are

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6616-1
00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:05.654
mandatory and non mandatory
cause it's GD S policy to the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6616-2
00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:09.430
user friendly and allow them to
type in whatever they want into

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6616-3
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.911
their application and make the
process easy for the person

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6616-4
00:45:12.911 --> 00:45:15.448
applying. Not so easy for the
caseworkers.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6619-0
00:45:16.538 --> 00:45:16.988
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6620-0
00:45:16.998 --> 00:45:17.478
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6644-0
00:45:18.148 --> 00:45:21.408
Half of Home Office projects, by
the way. If you think dot, if

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6644-1
00:45:21.408 --> 00:45:24.513
you think status half of those
projects are purely mappings

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6644-2
00:45:24.513 --> 00:45:25.548
between all the new.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6665-0
00:45:26.238 --> 00:45:29.934
That's what I've just learned on
status similar to dot. It's all

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6665-1
00:45:29.934 --> 00:45:33.688
about mappings. What does a mean
in new system it's actually see.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6667-0
00:45:34.518 --> 00:45:34.988
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6669-0
00:45:35.948 --> 00:45:36.168
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6671-0
00:45:36.298 --> 00:45:36.608
A.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6725-0
00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:42.133
So so I think I think there is
one thing that we should float,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6725-1
00:45:42.133 --> 00:45:45.957
Chris, and it's probably it's a
shame, nice and generally carry

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6725-2
00:45:45.957 --> 00:45:49.841
on on on the call, but we should
float this with with the the DS

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6708-0
00:45:49.628 --> 00:45:49.928
Yep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6725-3
00:45:49.841 --> 00:45:53.666
A-Team and our and if Dan in if
you can mention it to Dan cause

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6725-4
00:45:53.666 --> 00:45:55.758
we still can talk to Mike
Siggins.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6727-0
00:45:56.228 --> 00:45:56.588
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6742-0
00:45:56.808 --> 00:45:59.186
So we should mention cause I
know we've they've experimented

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6742-1
00:45:59.186 --> 00:46:00.668
with the tools like this in the
past.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6758-0
00:46:01.988 --> 00:46:05.110
But I don't. I don't think that
the quality of them's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6758-1
00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:07.308
necessarily been there cause the
the.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6769-0
00:46:08.668 --> 00:46:12.418
The way the data is stored is
not straight forward.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6782-0
00:46:13.558 --> 00:46:17.150
So you need to understand the
the, the the business model and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6782-1
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.788
data model.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-0
00:46:19.618 --> 00:46:23.518
You know, you could convince
elation to do a free pilot right

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-1
00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:27.418
for proof of concept or somebody
like elation, right? I mean,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-2
00:46:27.418 --> 00:46:31.318
there are two or three of these
kind of tools, but that gives

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6804-0
00:46:27.498 --> 00:46:27.708
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-3
00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:34.904
you a picture of a map. Yeah, a
heat map. And then quite

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-4
00:46:34.904 --> 00:46:38.867
quickly, you know, gets people
focused on where the key issues

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6836-5
00:46:38.867 --> 00:46:40.188
are. Yeah, I've used.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6876-0
00:46:39.528 --> 00:46:43.160
Well, there's a direct is it say
there's it more direct link to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6876-1
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.565
your previous point out and
about, you know pain points and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6876-2
00:46:46.565 --> 00:46:50.084
moments of value because the
amount of time caseworkers spend

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6876-3
00:46:50.084 --> 00:46:53.773
chasing stuff around because of
poor quality data or fixing poor

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6876-4
00:46:53.773 --> 00:46:57.178
quality data that they could
probably put a number on that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6875-0
00:46:56.848 --> 00:46:57.178
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6880-0
00:46:58.198 --> 00:47:00.628
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6893-0
00:47:02.568 --> 00:47:05.221
I I know Homeland Security
users, US Homeland Security

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6893-1
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:06.138
users solution now.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6900-0
00:47:07.628 --> 00:47:10.118
OK, so probably good enough
reference.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6912-0
00:47:10.898 --> 00:47:14.975
And I and I think like they
gonna expect. Cause I think

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6912-1
00:47:14.975 --> 00:47:15.558
there's.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6930-0
00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:20.704
More probably, more
opportunities in the irregular

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6930-1
00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:24.771
migration. So the asylum world
and there is in the standard

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6930-2
00:47:24.771 --> 00:47:25.178
world.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6932-0
00:47:25.698 --> 00:47:25.898
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6981-0
00:47:26.228 --> 00:47:30.291
Just because it's if the Home
Office can predict patterns of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6981-1
00:47:30.291 --> 00:47:34.421
irregular migration, it can be
better at dealing with them to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6954-0
00:47:33.478 --> 00:47:33.758
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6981-2
00:47:34.421 --> 00:47:38.618
like these previous point. And
you know the rise in small boat

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6981-3
00:47:38.618 --> 00:47:42.415
crossings is a result of, you
know, political and social

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6981-4
00:47:42.415 --> 00:47:42.948
factors.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6983-0
00:47:43.708 --> 00:47:44.278
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/6985-0
00:47:45.108 --> 00:47:45.778
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-0
00:47:46.618 --> 00:47:50.076
You know, when you look at, I
think, I mean one of the things

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-1
00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:53.591
that Luca posted like using kind
of imagery to spot where like

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-2
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:57.050
boats are likely to cross and
all of that sort of stuff to to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-3
00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.230
kind of target the resources
that the government has got

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-4
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:03.633
where it makes sense. A lot of
it is still kind of judgement

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7043-5
00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:06.478
and human intelligence at the
moment, I would say.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7039-0
00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:05.328
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7062-0
00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:11.545
Um yet it costs the asylum
process is what costs the Home

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7062-1
00:48:11.545 --> 00:48:15.572
Office the most. Keeping people
in asylum that end to end

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7062-2
00:48:15.572 --> 00:48:16.128
process.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7070-0
00:48:18.588 --> 00:48:21.208
You know, 111 of the.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7066-0
00:48:18.868 --> 00:48:19.298
So.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-0
00:48:22.078 --> 00:48:25.239
Things I did for Pearson, right?
The Footsie 100 company where

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-1
00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:28.100
they had allsorts of issues,
right. Double definition of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-2
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.910
books. Yeah. And double
definition of customers is it's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-3
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.072
very hard to launch a project to
clean up data because it's an

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-4
00:48:34.072 --> 00:48:37.133
ongoing thing. There's lack of
discipline. It occurs all the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7117-0
00:48:36.968 --> 00:48:37.188
Yep.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-5
00:48:37.133 --> 00:48:40.044
time was to create like a
perpetual studio. Right. So the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-6
00:48:40.044 --> 00:48:43.005
studio sits in the middle and
it's only job is to make the

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-7
00:48:43.005 --> 00:48:46.116
data efficient. So what happens
is it constantly works in use

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-8
00:48:46.116 --> 00:48:49.077
cases, tackling the easy ones
first, then getting more and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7167-9
00:48:49.077 --> 00:48:51.938
more difficult and then getting
more and more difficult.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-0
00:48:52.178 --> 00:48:55.470
And then the squats in the
studio tackle different aspects

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-1
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.041
of, you know, data quality, data
governance and data assurance.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-2
00:48:59.041 --> 00:49:02.444
And therefore you have a focal
point. And then the studio is

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-3
00:49:02.444 --> 00:49:05.904
tasked with making sure that you
know every Sprint two weekly

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-4
00:49:05.904 --> 00:49:09.251
sprints. It's delivering some
form of value back. Yeah. And

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-5
00:49:09.251 --> 00:49:12.711
that gives them the what I call
permanent execution muscle to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-6
00:49:12.711 --> 00:49:16.226
fix the data after six months,
nine months, 12 months. You had

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-7
00:49:16.226 --> 00:49:19.462
a much better state than
launching a project to say, hey,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7242-8
00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:21.248
I'm gonna just fix the data now.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7250-0
00:49:23.848 --> 00:49:26.208
Yeah, yeah. And and I think that
they have got.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-0
00:49:27.028 --> 00:49:30.932
Haven't called it a studio, but
they've had teams in their

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-1
00:49:30.932 --> 00:49:35.034
charge with data quality, data
governance and everything. But

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-2
00:49:35.034 --> 00:49:38.938
the problem still persists
because I I think like you, you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7275-0
00:49:36.228 --> 00:49:36.568
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-3
00:49:38.938 --> 00:49:42.776
want to automate this. The
resolution of that problem and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-4
00:49:42.776 --> 00:49:46.614
not not put humans in the
picture cause they're just lazy

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-5
00:49:46.614 --> 00:49:49.922
and prone to, you know,
ministerial direction and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7317-6
00:49:49.922 --> 00:49:52.768
careers and all that sort of
stuff, right?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7313-0
00:49:51.978 --> 00:49:52.878
Yeah, that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7325-0
00:49:53.538 --> 00:49:55.858
Bad robots. You've got a lot of
bad robots in there.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7324-0
00:49:55.068 --> 00:49:55.348
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7327-0
00:49:56.348 --> 00:49:56.708
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-0
00:49:57.698 --> 00:50:01.363
So I think there's, I think
there's something there, but I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-1
00:50:01.363 --> 00:50:05.153
mean, I guess Chris would be
worth knowing whether they they

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-2
00:50:05.153 --> 00:50:08.570
would consider like the
irregular migration as part of

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7358-0
00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:08.878
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-3
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.670
the FB stuff just because I know
through the ACE contract they've

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-4
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.273
they've gone out to market to
get someone to facilitate a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-5
00:50:16.273 --> 00:50:20.312
hackathon which we've responded
with Callum earlier on to go and

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7382-0
00:50:18.628 --> 00:50:18.968
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-6
00:50:20.312 --> 00:50:24.226
where you've got the head of UK
viewer that's looking for kind

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7405-7
00:50:24.226 --> 00:50:27.208
of aiml type solutions to help
with the asylum.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7406-0
00:50:27.698 --> 00:50:27.898
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7423-0
00:50:27.898 --> 00:50:32.077
So hopefully we'll push it and
open door on that one and an A

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7423-1
00:50:32.077 --> 00:50:34.908
WS are keen to help us in that
space too.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7427-0
00:50:36.208 --> 00:50:36.628
Um.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7428-0
00:50:36.418 --> 00:50:36.888
I mean.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7471-0
00:50:38.148 --> 00:50:40.854
But but I don't know whether
it's worth just if you've got

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7471-1
00:50:40.854 --> 00:50:43.515
someone available for work, we
could just get him to do a

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7471-2
00:50:43.515 --> 00:50:46.129
little bit of a troll against
this journey and go what's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7471-3
00:50:46.129 --> 00:50:48.881
happening in the rest of the
world and see if that triggers

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7471-4
00:50:48.881 --> 00:50:49.478
any thoughts.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7490-0
00:50:50.788 --> 00:50:54.507
Don't know whether I'm Alan nor
Norah. That's something that you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7490-1
00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:57.998
might be interested in doing
from a development perspective.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7538-0
00:51:04.248 --> 00:51:07.661
I can see you nothing Alan say.
Yeah. OK. So I think if you

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7498-0
00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:05.588
Yes.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7538-1
00:51:07.661 --> 00:51:11.130
could maybe spend a few days
just sort of trolling, trolling

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7538-2
00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.316
and seeing what's out there and
also maybe speak to our

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7538-3
00:51:14.316 --> 00:51:17.956
knowledge processing teams, our
PPC team, they might be able to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7538-4
00:51:17.956 --> 00:51:20.118
do a bit of research for you as
well.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7541-0
00:51:21.418 --> 00:51:22.008
Cheers Alan.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7548-0
00:51:24.058 --> 00:51:24.668
Thank you.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7559-0
00:51:24.068 --> 00:51:26.657
And then I think that that
release get the juices flowing

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7559-1
00:51:26.657 --> 00:51:28.398
for you, Chris Rayner with the
client.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7558-0
00:51:27.988 --> 00:51:28.278
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7561-0
00:51:29.028 --> 00:51:29.278
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7583-0
00:51:30.408 --> 00:51:33.179
I mean, it's some very, very
interesting topics here and it's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7583-1
00:51:33.179 --> 00:51:35.860
interesting to know about the
tools like elation out there,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7583-2
00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:36.978
Lee, the final word then.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-0
00:51:37.648 --> 00:51:41.312
Yeah. So I should say that, you
know, you could do worse than

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-1
00:51:41.312 --> 00:51:44.740
introducing them to Microsoft
copilot as well. And again,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-2
00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:48.464
we've got funding to do a proof
of concept from Microsoft with

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-3
00:51:48.464 --> 00:51:52.128
that, you know, that introducing
essentially a large language

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-4
00:51:52.128 --> 00:51:55.970
modelling into Microsoft Office
suite and assuming they're using

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7640-5
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:59.398
Microsoft Office, and that could
help them substantially.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7635-0
00:51:56.668 --> 00:51:56.898
Hmm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7668-0
00:52:00.128 --> 00:52:03.406
And I'm just, you know, very
easy and quick use cases. It's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7668-1
00:52:03.406 --> 00:52:06.794
backed by Microsoft, and it can
be trained to do exactly what

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7668-2
00:52:06.794 --> 00:52:10.128
they want without any kind of
custom building of capability.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7698-0
00:52:11.368 --> 00:52:14.780
Yeah. So if you take that on top
of all of the immigration laws,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7698-1
00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:18.245
because the immigration laws are
like in a book about that thick,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7698-2
00:52:18.245 --> 00:52:21.028
you could could use it to help
drive some, you know.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7705-0
00:52:22.188 --> 00:52:24.838
Ohh, people could ask for advice
so.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7711-0
00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:26.688
Yeah, very easy and quick to do.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7754-0
00:52:27.998 --> 00:52:31.595
OK, good idea, Sir. Guys. OK,
I'll let let me take that away.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7754-1
00:52:31.595 --> 00:52:35.192
Thank you very much. Your time.
I appreciate it's a big topic

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7754-2
00:52:35.192 --> 00:52:38.382
and maybe you could have
organised a bit better, but I

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7754-3
00:52:38.382 --> 00:52:42.095
get the key points here. So what
I'll do is I'll I'll summarise

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7754-4
00:52:42.095 --> 00:52:43.778
the transcript as best I can.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7764-0
00:52:43.858 --> 00:52:47.724
And and put in some suggestions
for next steps with the Home

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7764-1
00:52:47.724 --> 00:52:48.168
Office.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7806-0
00:52:48.868 --> 00:52:52.234
Um, I things that we could do or
or provide input to, but that

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7806-1
00:52:52.234 --> 00:52:55.439
was very, very useful and I will
circle back to this group,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7806-2
00:52:55.439 --> 00:52:58.699
particularly with my write up to
see if there's anything I'm

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7806-3
00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:01.958
missing. But I do appreciate it.
We recorded it so hopefully

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7806-4
00:53:01.958 --> 00:53:03.828
we've managed together
everything.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7816-0
00:53:04.378 --> 00:53:07.521
Um, is there anything else
before we close you like to

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7816-1
00:53:07.521 --> 00:53:07.978
mention?

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7835-0
00:53:08.228 --> 00:53:11.324
Talk. Talk to Rory Scott and see
if you can come to automatically

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7835-1
00:53:11.324 --> 00:53:13.998
analyse the the the transcript
and summarise it for you.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7846-0
00:53:15.748 --> 00:53:17.558
That's what he's developing,
yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7844-0
00:53:15.778 --> 00:53:16.618
Rory Scott.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7853-0
00:53:18.368 --> 00:53:19.118
It's pretty cool.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7860-0
00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:20.488
Remember to get it for us at the
start of Dallas.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7865-0
00:53:21.108 --> 00:53:21.778
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7876-0
00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:24.608
Food or just take it in to
ChatGPT.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7866-0
00:53:21.538 --> 00:53:21.988
Yeah, yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7870-0
00:53:22.918 --> 00:53:23.068
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7905-0
00:53:25.038 --> 00:53:28.507
Yeah, that's sweet. It did. And
he put some light visualisations

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7881-0
00:53:25.628 --> 00:53:25.948
Ohh.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7905-1
00:53:28.507 --> 00:53:31.923
on on it. So it basically said
the Dallas team were pretty flat

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7892-0
00:53:29.498 --> 00:53:29.728
It.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7905-2
00:53:31.923 --> 00:53:34.538
when they delivered the
presentation and boring.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7925-0
00:53:35.288 --> 00:53:38.782
This what? What? What took away
from the analysis now no real

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7925-1
00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.938
insight. I've never seen the
dials so flat on anything.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7927-0
00:53:43.578 --> 00:53:44.068
Sorry.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7967-0
00:53:44.828 --> 00:53:47.953
But it might might be better
here. I mean I guess I think

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7967-1
00:53:47.953 --> 00:53:51.456
Chris would be a test of the FBS
programme, right? But have they

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7967-2
00:53:51.456 --> 00:53:54.689
got on updated service map that
shows the end to end. So in

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7967-3
00:53:54.689 --> 00:53:57.438
Ian's one is that's about three
or four years old.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7983-0
00:53:57.638 --> 00:54:01.236
That there is one, but obviously
it's on the other side. I can't,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7972-0
00:53:58.148 --> 00:53:58.498
I'm.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7983-1
00:54:01.236 --> 00:54:02.708
I can't use it here easily.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7988-0
00:54:03.228 --> 00:54:04.848
The phases we can pull out
though.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7998-0
00:54:04.988 --> 00:54:06.498
Pull out the head. Yeah, the
headlines.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/7991-0
00:54:05.118 --> 00:54:05.418
Yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8010-0
00:54:06.518 --> 00:54:08.890
Headings. Yeah, I could get
someone in my team to do that.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8010-1
00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:10.298
We have got access to it, I
think.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8018-0
00:54:11.338 --> 00:54:13.168
So I'll do that as well as
action.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-0
00:54:12.728 --> 00:54:16.350
And and then Callum might be
able to kind of anecdotally pull

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-1
00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:19.739
out where some of the pain
points are, cause I guess it's

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-2
00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:23.361
that they're on a journey to fix
some of these things anyway,

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-3
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:26.458
where could aim may be
accelerate in that space, but

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-4
00:54:26.458 --> 00:54:30.139
also then got power, as always,
been finding those like hidden

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-5
00:54:30.139 --> 00:54:33.878
Nuggets that will drive material
improvement like, you know, if

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-6
00:54:33.878 --> 00:54:37.617
you fix your data quality, that
will allow you to do XYZ rather

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-7
00:54:37.617 --> 00:54:40.655
than ohh, let's do facial
recognition at the border

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8090-8
00:54:40.655 --> 00:54:42.058
because they're already.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8117-0
00:54:43.038 --> 00:54:45.966
On track to do that? Yeah. And
that none of that's gonna work

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8100-0
00:54:43.258 --> 00:54:44.518
Looking to yeah.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8117-1
00:54:45.966 --> 00:54:48.517
unless you can identify the
person and identify their

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8117-2
00:54:48.517 --> 00:54:48.848
status.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8123-0
00:54:49.888 --> 00:54:51.738
Which is all data related.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8120-0
00:54:50.248 --> 00:54:50.488
And.

2a71ec0d-6267-4af9-b1fe-bd3e8eb5ab90/8135-0
00:54:52.248 --> 00:54:56.348
Yeah, okay. Thank you very much,
