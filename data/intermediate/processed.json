{"timestamp":"0:00","text":"so I think we are fine to get started and the first thing on the agenda"}
{"timestamp":"0:05","text":"is oh"}
{"timestamp":"0:13","text":"the first thing on our agenda is a message from Dr Philip ormondsey"}
{"timestamp":"0:19","text":"oh I should have used this slide I'm just realizing that sorry I hear that thing I've said all of that"}
{"timestamp":"0:25","text":"all right thanks yeah thank you very much and thank you for hosting this Market engagement event"}
{"timestamp":"0:31","text":"uh welcome everyone uh to this event we're really delighted to have you here it's great to see that CCS Crown"}
{"timestamp":"0:39","text":"commercial service and hmrc a collaborating on such an important"}
{"timestamp":"0:44","text":"um activity not just for hmrc but for the oil of government um Legacy migration Legacy encapsulation"}
{"timestamp":"0:52","text":"Legacy remediation is quite topical right now most of um what we spend in government you know"}
{"timestamp":"0:59","text":"goes to where is managing our Legacy estate so it's really good to see us working collaboratively with hmrc to"}
{"timestamp":"1:06","text":"launch this this framework um ccs and Andrew tomasi through the"}
{"timestamp":"1:13","text":"creation of our Dallas agreement supports the public sector strategic approach to migrating from Legacy"}
{"timestamp":"1:20","text":"applications and we're hoping that our partners will support us again in this"}
{"timestamp":"1:25","text":"in this in this venture to ensure that we do this right but do it um at a cost"}
{"timestamp":"1:32","text":"um effective and valid delivery"}
{"timestamp":"1:37","text":"process Dallas will offer an easy approach to assist in the provision of"}
{"timestamp":"1:44","text":"more cost effective and innovative solutions um again not just for HMR see but for"}
{"timestamp":"1:49","text":"the oil of government so my team and the team at the hmrc are looking forward to hearing from you all on this approach"}
{"timestamp":"1:56","text":"and on how we can ensure the success of yet another CCS agreement"}
{"timestamp":"2:01","text":"um please um listening to the conversations that our teams are going to be having with you this morning and uh continue the"}
{"timestamp":"2:08","text":"dialogue and the engagement and um I wish I wish you know all participants in this engagement are very"}
{"timestamp":"2:16","text":"successful event thank you very much for attending and hopefully um hope to see or speak or interact with"}
{"timestamp":"2:23","text":"you all pretty soon thank you"}
{"timestamp":"2:35","text":"right thank you Philip and well thanks to everybody for coming uh I'd like to"}
{"timestamp":"2:41","text":"make a welcome from hmrc to everybody both in the room and online it's still a"}
{"timestamp":"2:47","text":"still a bit of a novelty as they're seeing everybody back face to face and it is uh it's absolutely great to see so thank you very much for that and I'm"}
{"timestamp":"2:53","text":"going to give an introduction uh to why why we're doing this why is hmrc with"}
{"timestamp":"2:59","text":"our friends in CTS building this framework and what's the purpose so this is really the vehicle for the"}
{"timestamp":"3:07","text":"next stage in the technology sourcing program tsp hopefully most of you in the room will have heard of tsp we'll have a"}
{"timestamp":"3:14","text":"knowledge of of tsp but what effectively tsp is is bringing the brain back in to"}
{"timestamp":"3:21","text":"hmrc we've been outsourced for a long long time and a lot of the knowledge has"}
{"timestamp":"3:26","text":"sat with third-party suppliers tsp is all about bringing the brain back in and"}
{"timestamp":"3:33","text":"so far what have we done we've done the disaggregation of the contracts but that's very much the start of tsp it is"}
{"timestamp":"3:40","text":"not what tsp is about so the disaggregation so far has been taking those big monolithic outsourced"}
{"timestamp":"3:47","text":"contracts and breaking them up into smaller contracts but what we've done is"}
{"timestamp":"3:52","text":"we've taken one of Monopoly contracts easy for me to say and we've broken them down into much"}
{"timestamp":"3:58","text":"smaller Monopoly contracts and we've done that for a couple of reasons the mature of hmrc didn't enable us to go"}
{"timestamp":"4:07","text":"from where we were to where we want to be in one jump and also we had time constraints to get us to where we needed"}
{"timestamp":"4:14","text":"to be so Dallas is going to provide us that next level of contract vehicle to get"}
{"timestamp":"4:21","text":"the maturity of hmrc to help build that intelligent client to help us take the"}
{"timestamp":"4:27","text":"applications and our services to the next level so there's three main aims of"}
{"timestamp":"4:33","text":"Dallas they all begin with C which makes it nice and easy to remember capability its capacity and its"}
{"timestamp":"4:40","text":"competition what Dallas aims to do is down select a smaller group of suppliers who will have"}
{"timestamp":"4:47","text":"the confidence that they are going to get significant work from hmrc so they"}
{"timestamp":"4:54","text":"are able to invest in hmrc really getting to know hmrc and provide the"}
{"timestamp":"5:01","text":"best quality of service to hmrc having multiple providers though gives"}
{"timestamp":"5:08","text":"us the best capacity I don't think I've ever known such squeeze on capacity as"}
{"timestamp":"5:15","text":"we have right now so relying on two smaller number of suppliers puts it at risk and I think we've just seen across"}
{"timestamp":"5:23","text":"lots of areas over the last 12 24 months how important diversity in the supply"}
{"timestamp":"5:28","text":"chain is and this will help us with that as well and then finally competition"}
{"timestamp":"5:34","text":"small number of suppliers that are pre-down selected means that we can keep competition helps Drive value for money"}
{"timestamp":"5:41","text":"or we can also do it quicker so instead of having to run procurements it takes months through the Dallas framework we"}
{"timestamp":"5:47","text":"should be able to turn things around in a matter of weeks so they're the three main drivers you'll get some more detail"}
{"timestamp":"5:53","text":"today and this is the first of of a whole string of of Market engagement so"}
{"timestamp":"5:59","text":"we really do want to hear your thoughts as well at the end of it we've got some questions um but we also have follow-up sessions"}
{"timestamp":"6:06","text":"so I'm now going to hand over to Mike"}
{"timestamp":"6:12","text":"thank you Lee good morning all uh my name is Mike Hannan um I'm the category lead within CCS for"}
{"timestamp":"6:19","text":"technology Services cyber and Technology transport and our my team will be"}
{"timestamp":"6:25","text":"looking after the Dallas framework and making sure that goes live yeah and we're really pleased to be"}
{"timestamp":"6:30","text":"working with hmrc as Philip said to get this off the road because we think it's a good good idea a good way of bringing"}
{"timestamp":"6:37","text":"in and changing the way the the Legacy services are developed and maintained"}
{"timestamp":"6:43","text":"okay just uh Sean to the next slide so this is what we think the the lighting structure looks like we're pretty sure"}
{"timestamp":"6:49","text":"this is about how we're going to look forward against a little bit more detail of the lot names and what goes through"}
{"timestamp":"6:55","text":"and and Phil we'll go through more of those in the level of detail why they're there for supported hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"7:02","text":"and clearly this is we've been talking to other government departments as well and they are looking to do something"}
{"timestamp":"7:08","text":"very similar to this so we're trying to build this so it's a capability that's available for all uh government"}
{"timestamp":"7:15","text":"departments okay so um as as Lee said we're trying"}
{"timestamp":"7:20","text":"to look at the rationalize the number of suppliers across each of the lots to ensure that we got the the right"}
{"timestamp":"7:25","text":"suppliers in there the right competition the right capabilities um to align those so you know we will go"}
{"timestamp":"7:31","text":"into further detail around that um ecosystem it this more or less aligns"}
{"timestamp":"7:36","text":"to what are the type of suppliers we're looking for within those areas and and Phil again we'll go into more detail"}
{"timestamp":"7:42","text":"around what they look like and why we've got them there we just flip onto the next slide so"}
{"timestamp":"7:49","text":"um I'm not going to go through all the level of details within there's a lot of detail on there but but effectively this"}
{"timestamp":"7:54","text":"is a design service aspect for lot one um we're looking at the support and the"}
{"timestamp":"8:00","text":"delivery aspects for that design design activity okay until"}
{"timestamp":"8:06","text":"okay and this is the larger scale integration and development services so we're looking for large-scale"}
{"timestamp":"8:12","text":"organizations to support this these were very larger values across the the programs of activity hmrc will be"}
{"timestamp":"8:20","text":"putting out and we move on to 2B and these are the for the smaller SME level suppliers"}
{"timestamp":"8:27","text":"with this lower level lower value but you know still great capability that need to support hmrc and other Supply"}
{"timestamp":"8:34","text":"and other customers on okay lot three is integration and run"}
{"timestamp":"8:40","text":"Services um you know there's nothing new there the these These are still required"}
{"timestamp":"8:46","text":"um again large-scale suppliers they are big platforms big activities they're going through that will need supporting"}
{"timestamp":"8:54","text":"um configuration Services again lot 4A is the larger scale Prime aspects with"}
{"timestamp":"9:02","text":"um ecosystems of suppliers supporting this uh this service again lots of the"}
{"timestamp":"9:08","text":"the normal activities that you'd expect within the configuration service and and until up 4B and 4B we talk about the The"}
{"timestamp":"9:16","text":"Specialist so we're back into an SME environment of how that and what that helps deliver"}
{"timestamp":"9:22","text":"in smaller programs smaller projects activities and again it would all be"}
{"timestamp":"9:28","text":"aligned through as one one activity for for hmrc so they can manage all of the"}
{"timestamp":"9:34","text":"supply base and we look at the other customers are looking for that as well yeah if we move on to five and this is a"}
{"timestamp":"9:42","text":"capability pipeline for Academy um trading as Lee said you've lost lost"}
{"timestamp":"9:49","text":"knowledge lost a capabilities within the organization and this is then building up and putting back in that knowledge"}
{"timestamp":"9:57","text":"within hmrc and we know this from lots of other government partners that are this is also required it's something"}
{"timestamp":"10:04","text":"that is missing and they want to bring back from all their years of Outsourcing"}
{"timestamp":"10:11","text":"um I'm going to head over to Phil now to just go into what the next aspects looks like in"}
{"timestamp":"10:17","text":"terms of what they think the value is going through the the framework at this level for hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"10:28","text":"good morning I'm Phil desbrie associate director for it commercial my particular focus is as the commercial lead for hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"10:36","text":"for the Dallas project delivering that alongside our colleagues in CCS if we"}
{"timestamp":"10:42","text":"can move on to the next slide you'll see an expanded view here of the last instructor that Mike's already shown you"}
{"timestamp":"10:48","text":"so just to explain this in a bit more detail so when we were conceptualizing this model"}
{"timestamp":"10:55","text":"we started to look at some of the challenges and problems that hmrc faced"}
{"timestamp":"11:01","text":"so in the digital space for example digital development we had a situation"}
{"timestamp":"11:06","text":"where we had a very small number of suppliers who had to be assigned to do one particular piece of activity so we"}
{"timestamp":"11:11","text":"didn't have ongoing competitive tension and we struggled to adopt the GDs"}
{"timestamp":"11:18","text":"approach to Rainbow teams where you would have individuals from multiple suppliers working together to"}
{"timestamp":"11:24","text":"deliver the same types of things and when we have been able to do that with an hmrc what that's tended to mean"}
{"timestamp":"11:31","text":"is that you've had a hmrc person looking after that rainbow team and therefore the risk for delivery all stays with"}
{"timestamp":"11:38","text":"hmrc rather than being transferred into the market so we started off with that"}
{"timestamp":"11:44","text":"as a strategic problem and then started to build around this as to what the loss instructor should look like so as Mike's"}
{"timestamp":"11:50","text":"already pointed out we have some large-scale suppliers operating in the digital space today"}
{"timestamp":"11:55","text":"what we want to do is bolster that capability by bringing in opportunities for smaller suppliers smes of course but"}
{"timestamp":"12:02","text":"we're not being restrictive about that and in lap 2A and 2B one of the restrictions we are going to make is"}
{"timestamp":"12:08","text":"that if for the suppliers that bid they cannot be on both Lots so that will give us the opportunity to"}
{"timestamp":"12:15","text":"have a nice mix of both larger suppliers and smaller suppliers lot 3 which will also be delivered as"}
{"timestamp":"12:22","text":"part of the first wave of competition activity as Mike said is largely based"}
{"timestamp":"12:27","text":"on the Legacy run services that exist today so you will you will already know from TSP we've competed things like"}
{"timestamp":"12:34","text":"corporation tax we've competed things like child Benefit services and real-time information"}
{"timestamp":"12:40","text":"those services are going to be ultimately within that lot but you'll also see services that currently exist"}
{"timestamp":"12:46","text":"in borders and trade in that lot the services that we have retained with"}
{"timestamp":"12:51","text":"some incumbent suppliers that cover things like self-assessment that cover paye that cover banking services over"}
{"timestamp":"12:58","text":"time they will start to exit those contracts and will also drop into this framework as a means of procuring those"}
{"timestamp":"13:05","text":"services and when you think about the number of suppliers that we've we've um put here"}
{"timestamp":"13:11","text":"as our aspiration that's very much focused on the point that Lee made about very rapid"}
{"timestamp":"13:17","text":"competition so what you can expect to see as we go through this process and we'll describe"}
{"timestamp":"13:22","text":"it in a bit more detail later in the presentation is to take steps to robustly pre-qualify the suppliers that"}
{"timestamp":"13:29","text":"we appoint on the basis of their capacity their capability their ability to work together with other suppliers"}
{"timestamp":"13:36","text":"and the reason we need that is because when we have a trusted supplier group we are then able to share much more"}
{"timestamp":"13:42","text":"information with that trusted supplier group with the best will in the world and for all of the wonderful things that CCS has"}
{"timestamp":"13:48","text":"done with their Frameworks it's impossible for us to be able to share the level of information that we have"}
{"timestamp":"13:53","text":"with 150 suppliers on tech services three or three thousand suppliers on dos if we have a smaller group of suppliers"}
{"timestamp":"14:01","text":"we can be much more open about our pipelines we could be much more open about our architecture about our"}
{"timestamp":"14:06","text":"Journeys about what's happening a year in advance when the plans crystallize what's happening three months in advance"}
{"timestamp":"14:11","text":"and that information sharing will enable suppliers to be better placed to respond"}
{"timestamp":"14:17","text":"toward a rapid competition approach so we're anticipating that once this lands we'll be able in a lot of cases"}
{"timestamp":"14:22","text":"particularly in Lots two and four to turn competitions around and around about four to six weeks so it's quite a"}
{"timestamp":"14:29","text":"move from where we are now where we average about 14 weeks for a Dos competition in about five months for a"}
{"timestamp":"14:35","text":"competition through tech services three so quite a difference to what we see today"}
{"timestamp":"14:41","text":"so those suppliers you'll see from the the screen will be required in some cases to have an SME ecosystem with them"}
{"timestamp":"14:48","text":"so that will be in the lot where we are not specifically targeting smes so in"}
{"timestamp":"14:54","text":"Lots 2B and 4B we're giving smes the opportunities to bid there and to try to remove the"}
{"timestamp":"14:59","text":"barriers to entry and as a consequence of that they won't be required to bring an SME ecosystem with them because"}
{"timestamp":"15:04","text":"that's quite an overhead for an SME anyway to front that for other smes in the lots that"}
{"timestamp":"15:11","text":"aren't specifically targeted at smes there will be some requirements there but we're going to make some changes to"}
{"timestamp":"15:17","text":"what was done within tsp so in tsp we had a requirement of a pass-through of"}
{"timestamp":"15:23","text":"at least 30 percent of revenues to an ecosystem of at least five suppliers in most of the cases what we're going to do"}
{"timestamp":"15:30","text":"in Dallas because we've got the equator SME consideration with those lots is reduce the revenue pass through to 20 to"}
{"timestamp":"15:37","text":"a minimum of three smes so that's perhaps a little bit more different and a little bit more attractive perhaps to"}
{"timestamp":"15:42","text":"some of the bidders the annual values that you see quoted that's a forecast value roughly based on"}
{"timestamp":"15:49","text":"our spend today so it's not a Target and it's not a commitment as such so we just need to position that correctly but"}
{"timestamp":"15:56","text":"that's what we anticipate spending each year over the course of the framework and the total value we've calculated"}
{"timestamp":"16:02","text":"over five years because as with all Frameworks there are certain contracts that you can let up to seven years be on"}
{"timestamp":"16:08","text":"the expiry of the framework so we're anticipating from a total value point of view that hmrcs spend alone will be in"}
{"timestamp":"16:15","text":"the order of about two billion pounds over the next five years now huge numbers as you can imagine and"}
{"timestamp":"16:21","text":"as Lee said huge pie to be able to go around a number of suppliers that will exist within this framework"}
{"timestamp":"16:28","text":"but thinking about it more broadly and Mike touched on this before and Philip are on Wednesday indeed about the fact"}
{"timestamp":"16:34","text":"that this is a CCS framework the overall value you'll have seen in the pin that was released to the market"}
{"timestamp":"16:39","text":"is four and a half billion which enables access from other government departments to be able to use"}
{"timestamp":"16:45","text":"some of the mechanisms and methods that we'll be using as part of setting this framework up"}
{"timestamp":"16:52","text":"so do we have another slide ah I'm handing over now to Tom skalach"}
{"timestamp":"16:57","text":"who's going to uh it's a video message because he can't be here in person today but I hope you'll enjoy this"}
{"timestamp":"17:03","text":"presentation"}
{"timestamp":"17:10","text":"hi I'm Tom skalach this is me talking about IIT strategy and the relevance to the"}
{"timestamp":"17:18","text":"Dallas framework what are the key principles of the hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"17:25","text":"technology strategy over the next four to five years the next four to five years ultimately"}
{"timestamp":"17:31","text":"we want increased agility reduced risk and a faster time to Market"}
{"timestamp":"17:37","text":"our systems are currently constraining us too much taking us a long time to produce Solutions and we have a lot of"}
{"timestamp":"17:45","text":"risk from Legacy applications and solutions we want to ultimately reduce the amount"}
{"timestamp":"17:51","text":"of applications we've got motor more platform and product based architecture"}
{"timestamp":"17:56","text":"set of platforms and products are produced on top of those"}
{"timestamp":"18:01","text":"we want strategically adopt the use of cloud ideally with as much as as a"}
{"timestamp":"18:07","text":"service as possible ideally software as a service if not platform as a service and below that"}
{"timestamp":"18:14","text":"infrastructure as a service ultimately where a vendor can provide a solution to us as a service and we can consume that"}
{"timestamp":"18:21","text":"and we can add the value add for hmrc can deliver on top of that for the products which are most fitting to our"}
{"timestamp":"18:28","text":"business needs and our customers needs we want to remove a lot of those Legacy"}
{"timestamp":"18:34","text":"systems and things that hold us back and things that cause a great deal of technical debts"}
{"timestamp":"18:39","text":"overall as a business we're moving to a more digital business we want to reduce the amount of contact that we've got and"}
{"timestamp":"18:45","text":"we want to have people self-serve and so we want solutions that can enable that and provide those customer facing"}
{"timestamp":"18:51","text":"systems for our customers to to consume the services and interact without taking"}
{"timestamp":"18:58","text":"expensive back office human interaction yeah ultimately we want to simplify we want"}
{"timestamp":"19:05","text":"less customizations ideally the only configurations and ideally not too many of those we want to"}
{"timestamp":"19:11","text":"be working to the systems and of the systems State this is what is common and it's only the particular things that are"}
{"timestamp":"19:17","text":"unique to hmrc that we add on top of those we see low code and no code as a big"}
{"timestamp":"19:24","text":"part of our future both enabling Business Development to be done inside"}
{"timestamp":"19:30","text":"the business and application development to be done there too so they can take power of Their Own"}
{"timestamp":"19:36","text":"Destiny and not be hindered from a core set of people that only know specific"}
{"timestamp":"19:41","text":"Technologies uh in specific areas we within that we also want the faster"}
{"timestamp":"19:47","text":"time to Market so we can quickly prototype and prove the concept and test out the things that we want to have in"}
{"timestamp":"19:53","text":"the future and see them as a reality rather than just through documents in a long-lived waterfall style uh"}
{"timestamp":"20:01","text":"development um time frame"}
{"timestamp":"20:07","text":"But ultimately really want to be moving away from code and it's just those configurations we want a service-based architecture so"}
{"timestamp":"20:14","text":"we can consume services and data from the applications where it's needed and"}
{"timestamp":"20:20","text":"overall together we have an integrated um ecosystem that delivers to our"}
{"timestamp":"20:26","text":"customers and business funds so with all this together we get increased agility"}
{"timestamp":"20:31","text":"reduced risk at a faster time to Market"}
{"timestamp":"20:38","text":"what are the key technologies that will enable this journey"}
{"timestamp":"20:45","text":"there are many technologies that fit those characteristics of what I'm described in this as a service World be"}
{"timestamp":"20:52","text":"that software as a service platform as a service or even if they're living on top of an infrastructure as a service and can also"}
{"timestamp":"20:59","text":"offer these kind of low code no code faster time to Market style Solutions"}
{"timestamp":"21:05","text":"examples of these are sap within both the uh Erp space and also in our tax"}
{"timestamp":"21:12","text":"collection and tax revenue Management Solutions service now a nice and power platforms"}
{"timestamp":"21:20","text":"or be that through service now with its itsm capabilities or other applications"}
{"timestamp":"21:25","text":"like nice and power where we can develop on top of those to find to automate in"}
{"timestamp":"21:31","text":"particular areas that are a little bit Niche to us we've got um"}
{"timestamp":"21:37","text":"documentum and Pega for managing our documents and our workflow processes"}
{"timestamp":"21:44","text":"as well as also advisor uis and simplified user experiences to both"}
{"timestamp":"21:52","text":"our customer and our internal user we've got AI Services as well making"}
{"timestamp":"21:58","text":"best use of our data Microsoft Dynamics for CRM and other"}
{"timestamp":"22:05","text":"case management cases and uses and products like Kong for our API"}
{"timestamp":"22:11","text":"management which is a key part of our integration moving forward these are just some examples and there"}
{"timestamp":"22:17","text":"are many more thank you what are the key characteristics that we"}
{"timestamp":"22:24","text":"are looking for from the supplier on this framework on supplies on this framework we're"}
{"timestamp":"22:30","text":"looking with for suppliers that collaborate with us work really closely"}
{"timestamp":"22:36","text":"be open to be flexible and agile but come with their deep expertise and deep knowledge what they've got in both"}
{"timestamp":"22:43","text":"their product but also where their products being applied within other government departments and in the"}
{"timestamp":"22:48","text":"outside world with one vendors and and suppliers who can continue to learn and learn with us"}
{"timestamp":"22:56","text":"and learn how best to apply uh these Technologies ultimately we want people who can be"}
{"timestamp":"23:02","text":"outcome based delivered to an outcome that that we set that our business and"}
{"timestamp":"23:07","text":"our customers need and the vendors and system integrators are prepared to take some skin on the game and deliver to the"}
{"timestamp":"23:14","text":"outcome not just the times the materials that could potentially go on forever"}
{"timestamp":"23:20","text":"we want people who want to who can understand hmrc both as an organization and as the systems and ecosystems that"}
{"timestamp":"23:27","text":"we've got in place right now we can't quickly just move to a green field and forget the old we've got we've"}
{"timestamp":"23:33","text":"got to on a journey to coexist both the Legacy and the new"}
{"timestamp":"23:41","text":"and ultimately we want people who can take opportunities from the rest of their ecosystem and bring to us"}
{"timestamp":"23:47","text":"all the knowledge from the other vendors and other suppliers that they work with"}
{"timestamp":"23:52","text":"and other customers and ultimately uh help hmrc do things faster and better"}
{"timestamp":"24:01","text":"what else are we looking for from suppliers to help us achieve our vision for it"}
{"timestamp":"24:09","text":"the framework is set up to allow suppliers to bring their broad knowledge and experience and learning from other government departments and industries"}
{"timestamp":"24:15","text":"into hmrc that's what we want we want to find a"}
{"timestamp":"24:21","text":"way to implement the best Solutions the fastest time the reduced cost and the"}
{"timestamp":"24:26","text":"reduced risk we want innovators who can help us bring an external perspective see the art of"}
{"timestamp":"24:33","text":"the possible and show us what we're potentially missing out on or what the next stage will be and potentially miss"}
{"timestamp":"24:39","text":"a few stages out and find intuitive ways to solving problems not just technology"}
{"timestamp":"24:44","text":"in certain areas"}
{"timestamp":"24:59","text":"oh okay thank you I'd like to now invite Jillian"}
{"timestamp":"25:04","text":"Bates to give her presentation she's joining online Jillian good morning good morning morning everyone sorry I can't be in the"}

{"timestamp":"36:15","text":"supplier-based staff to do mostly in development and platform support work"}
{"timestamp":"36:22","text":"okay if you come over to the next slide please thank you so how will we utilize the"}
{"timestamp":"36:29","text":"Dallas framework well we require strategic Partners to help us transform"}
{"timestamp":"36:35","text":"our Legacy Services we also need suppliers or the partners to provide"}
{"timestamp":"36:40","text":"platform support to integrate with our existing teams in some cases and provide"}
{"timestamp":"36:46","text":"expertise and also to provide development teams to enable us to"}
{"timestamp":"36:53","text":"increase our pipeline of work we're also looking for a mixed economy"}
{"timestamp":"36:58","text":"of of uh our contracts of outcomes so some will be fixed price some will be"}
{"timestamp":"37:05","text":"outcome based but essentially what we're trying to do is utilize the skills and expertise from suppliers to help augment"}
{"timestamp":"37:13","text":"our existing team to help us deliver what we need to do say we're keen to utilize skills and"}
{"timestamp":"37:21","text":"experience so we do have an intelligent client function as I said that is trying"}
{"timestamp":"37:26","text":"to retain the skills and expertise within hmrc but we want to utilize suppliers where they've got additional"}
{"timestamp":"37:33","text":"expertise and knowledge and and help us augment our skills"}
{"timestamp":"37:39","text":"and essentially we want to use the Dallas framework to reduce the number of resources overhead within within the"}
{"timestamp":"37:46","text":"team and also to help with the the burst capability within the team so when we"}
{"timestamp":"37:52","text":"have large demand or a greater demand we want to be able to flex with the"}
{"timestamp":"37:57","text":"suppliers that were brought in via the contracts and we move to the next"}
{"timestamp":"38:03","text":"Sub-Q okay so what are our strategic imperatives well we want to provide more"}
{"timestamp":"38:10","text":"flexible integration services to support future business needs and requirements"}
{"timestamp":"38:16","text":"and support innovation we want to migrate off of Legacy"}
{"timestamp":"38:21","text":"services that are inflexible expensive to run and don't scale"}
{"timestamp":"38:28","text":"we want to deliver integration faster and more effectively and cheaper and"}
{"timestamp":"38:34","text":"that will be done through API reuse and also through"}
{"timestamp":"38:41","text":"self-serve capabilities so one of the things that we're trying to do at the moment is build a platform"}
{"timestamp":"38:47","text":"that utilizes uh or creates a self-discovery mechanism and a"}
{"timestamp":"38:53","text":"self-serve Discovery a self self-serve mechanisms that essentially"}
{"timestamp":"38:58","text":"helps us to Federate out delivery so that it's not all uh"}
{"timestamp":"39:05","text":"confined within the one team within Eis so that we give projects the ability to deliver some of this stuff themselves"}
{"timestamp":"39:13","text":"and also we want to make sure that the products that we did develop and deliver"}
{"timestamp":"39:19","text":"ensure that we're secure that we meet gdpr and secure customer record"}
{"timestamp":"39:26","text":"standards so the benefits of that as I've described is to provide a self-serve for"}
{"timestamp":"39:34","text":"an internal and external customers we want to be highly scalable and resilient"}
{"timestamp":"39:39","text":"and have a stable set of products we want to simplify our integration"}
{"timestamp":"39:45","text":"footprint so we've got lots of Legacy services that we want to reduce"}
{"timestamp":"39:50","text":"and have much more flexible systems that are cloud-based and we also want to make them more"}
{"timestamp":"39:57","text":"efficient so we want to automate where possible use Auto scaling so that we're cost effective and only utilize"}
{"timestamp":"40:04","text":"resources when we need them and we want to a coherent set of"}
{"timestamp":"40:10","text":"integration patterns that are easily accessible through self-serve and self-discovery"}
{"timestamp":"40:17","text":"um that hopefully reduce time to Market and also the amount of development work that we need to do"}
{"timestamp":"40:27","text":"thank you very much um as Julian said I I will also be at"}
{"timestamp":"40:32","text":"the uh certain question session later on so thank you"}

{"timestamp":"41:49","text":"couple of things to to call out there are two lenses on us the change lens and"}
{"timestamp":"41:54","text":"they're both big okay I think that's the thing you need to take away with the largest portfolio of I.T change in hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"42:01","text":"now and ever so we do more delivery work than the cdio puts put together within"}
{"timestamp":"42:07","text":"our organization there is a there is a portfolio by the way who am I I'm the portfolio director for change so"}
{"timestamp":"42:15","text":"um there's a single program in there which is the largest IT program that HR hmrc or its or its forerunners has ever"}
{"timestamp":"42:24","text":"done that's the biggest all right okay that's the Customs decoration service"}

{"timestamp":"42:57","text":"the last 30 40 years not far off Okay so we've got large Legacy estate and our"}
{"timestamp":"43:05","text":"Legacy estate or our our entire estate the new services have real world impacts so the pictures"}
{"timestamp":"43:13","text":"on the right hand side are there to just bring it real okay for an example"}
{"timestamp":"43:18","text":"um and this is where we work with with suppliers to inside borders and freight and I will give you some I will give you"}
{"timestamp":"43:24","text":"some numbers now in a minute but we have real world impacts within hours so we"}

{"timestamp":"43:36","text":"roads in Kent fill up with lorries we Supply services that enables feel that"}
{"timestamp":"43:41","text":"enables felixstow to work which is the largest container port in in in the UK"}

{"timestamp":"43:52","text":"and of course Heathrow yeah and ferries uh and that and that and that channel"}
{"timestamp":"43:59","text":"too tunnel so the scale of the work that that we're doing let me talk a little"}
{"timestamp":"44:05","text":"bit about that over the next three years between run and build it's about one billion pounds worth of uh of work"}
{"timestamp":"44:12","text":"roughly uh three quarters of that is in is in change we use over 1 300 staff"}
{"timestamp":"44:22","text":"um internals and externals about 800 of those are external Circa the number goes"}
{"timestamp":"44:27","text":"up and down um to deliver those services to deliver that change to deliver the live but not"}
{"timestamp":"44:34","text":"just that we use 700 resources Circa in areas such as jillians and Richards who"}
{"timestamp":"44:41","text":"you've just heard heard from and others we have so trying to get over in that five minutes about the opportunities"}
{"timestamp":"44:48","text":"that are here and and the way we are supported by our supplier partners and"}
{"timestamp":"44:54","text":"they are partners so um whereas all our contracts are output"}
{"timestamp":"44:59","text":"based a lot of the services that we provide effectively we are the service integrators so we have rainbow we have"}
{"timestamp":"45:06","text":"rainbow teams of different suppliers performing different roles um inside us we are ddat as professions"}
{"timestamp":"45:14","text":"we're PD professions in the main um we are across 18 locations within the"}
{"timestamp":"45:20","text":"UK from Glasgow to Belfast to pretty much everywhere else mainly South End and London"}
{"timestamp":"45:26","text":"we as well we've heard a few times we're transforming to intelligent client as the rest of uh cdio but we need we also"}
{"timestamp":"45:34","text":"need Dallas to assist us not only to build an Iranian output based contracts like I said and burst capacity that not"}
{"timestamp":"45:42","text":"just burst capacity but uh as a firm partnership with our suppliers to do"}
{"timestamp":"45:50","text":"that build and run but making sure that we are intelligent client to make sure that whilst we use the skills you know"}
{"timestamp":"45:57","text":"no other no external knows more about our services than we do but that's not simple in sourcing and Outsourcing it's"}
{"timestamp":"46:03","text":"it's not quite as simple as that um lastly about the operating"}
{"timestamp":"46:08","text":"environment lens um we um we support multiple systems of"}
{"timestamp":"46:14","text":"critical National infrastructure so if you're not conversing with that term other examples are the West Coast main"}
{"timestamp":"46:21","text":"main line the M1 but we support the vat data Chief something called gvms which"}

{"timestamp":"52:04","text":"better at the work that they're doing now but we're not just focused on the here and now as I said we're also"}
{"timestamp":"52:10","text":"planning for the future as well so one of the key things that we're looking at is how do we help our people develop the"}

{"timestamp":"52:24","text":"only for their own personal benefit but also for the benefit of the organization"}
{"timestamp":"52:29","text":"um so how can we use take people whose skills might not be needed quite so much in the future and help them create"}
{"timestamp":"52:36","text":"skills that we are going to need and that are going to be in demand so as I mentioned we've got academies that do"}

{"timestamp":"53:40","text":"courses you know ways in which we can support people to learn whilst also of course not affecting the work that we do"}
{"timestamp":"53:47","text":"because learning is integral to everything that we do learning is where Innovation comes"}

{"timestamp":"56:29","text":"means that there's got to be a clear delineation with those services that already exist in lot 3 and the running"}
{"timestamp":"56:35","text":"of those services so different modes of operation so there will be different types of contracts that drop into those"}

{"timestamp":"58:25","text":"everything has been done for a long period of time by a group of outsourced suppliers and whilst we do have"}
{"timestamp":"58:31","text":"significant capability in the organization we do need to build that further so that we can validate and test"}
{"timestamp":"58:37","text":"the things that were being told by suppliers on an ongoing basis so part of the approach to building that"}
{"timestamp":"58:43","text":"intelligent client capability is to have a group of suppliers who can act as a"}
{"timestamp":"58:48","text":"council which will provide advice to Tom skellage as the C team do lead"}
{"timestamp":"58:54","text":"and also take on specific tasks and challenges in terms of trying to"}
{"timestamp":"59:00","text":"accelerate our transformation because what we want to do over the course of the next three to eight years"}
{"timestamp":"59:06","text":"really is to move towards an estate where predominantly it is configurable platforms and products so the quicker we"}
{"timestamp":"59:13","text":"can accelerate that the quicker we can get things into the cloud with those configurable platforms the quicker our"}
{"timestamp":"59:18","text":"overheads reduce and we have a better cost proposition overall"}
{"timestamp":"59:23","text":"so we need the support of the market certainly in the short term to be able to do that as we're building that"}
{"timestamp":"59:28","text":"capability but also within that you'll start to see some interesting and Innovative things that we're looking to propose so for"}
{"timestamp":"59:35","text":"example the suppliers within that lot may be involved in strategy and architecture design validation and what"}
{"timestamp":"59:41","text":"have you and by the way a copy of these slides will be made available for you to get all of the details of the content of"}
{"timestamp":"59:47","text":"the lot but there'll be things that you won't have seen hmrc or much of UK government"}
{"timestamp":"59:53","text":"do before that we're looking to propose for example facilitated settlers and coder sessions"}
{"timestamp":"59:59","text":"now some of you will be aware of what that is you'll have probably been involved in them but the process here is that a supplier set"}

{"timestamp":"1:00:48","text":"hmrc could make via the supplier to individual coders Who present solutions that solve problems which again is an"}
{"timestamp":"1:00:54","text":"interesting thing that's hmrc and much of government hasn't done before I think only gchq has done that so far in the UK"}
{"timestamp":"1:01:01","text":"um but it's becoming bigger in the Dutch government so I would expect it to expand as as time goes on and as we"}
{"timestamp":"1:01:07","text":"start moving through the slides we start to look at some of the additional features that we'll see and just to"}
{"timestamp":"1:01:14","text":"carry up before we move into this because this is a cross-government framework and will be accessible by any"}
{"timestamp":"1:01:20","text":"government Department as well as wider public sector whilst hmrc May well be adopting some of"}
{"timestamp":"1:01:28","text":"these things it's not going to be a requirement for the other government departments who are involved to adopt them they'll have to make their own"}

{"timestamp":"1:02:23","text":"requirements over 10 million pounds now there needs to be that social value impact that's included and one of the"}
{"timestamp":"1:02:29","text":"things we've been really happy to see is the response to this during the tech sourcing program competitions that we"}

{"timestamp":"1:02:53","text":"create opportunities in local communities working with those ecosystem Partners to"}

{"timestamp":"1:03:04","text":"throughout the life cycle of a particular statement of work we can start to see those organizations that"}

{"timestamp":"1:03:16","text":"but also into those local communities where there can be real impact as a result of the things that we do together"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:22","text":"Us in government and the suppliers cut out the next slide"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:30","text":"so in terms of the the fund allocation Lee mentioned at the outset that there's a real opportunity here for us to for"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:37","text":"suppliers to have a fairly sizable slice of the pie that's available now two"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:43","text":"billion pounds is an overall forecast is is a big number to start us off with but U.S suppliers are only likely to be"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:50","text":"interested in investing to the extent that we would want you to invest if you know you are guaranteed to make some"}
{"timestamp":"1:03:55","text":"money from this so one of the options hmrc plans to include in Lots two and"}
{"timestamp":"1:04:01","text":"four is the option to direct award on what we're calling a tiered taxi rank basis"}
{"timestamp":"1:04:07","text":"so what we'll do is create three value levels and in those value levels the suppliers are pointed to that framework"}
{"timestamp":"1:04:13","text":"a lot will literally take turns of getting work packages allocated to"}
{"timestamp":"1:04:18","text":"them up to a certain value level we're anticipating at the moment that that figure may be around 40 of the forecast"}
{"timestamp":"1:04:25","text":"value of the lot but that's not fixed yet but what that means is that there's a"}

{"timestamp":"1:04:57","text":"a team with us um and whilst this is clearly a wider government framework one of the things"}
{"timestamp":"1:05:05","text":"we'll ask suppliers to Warrant as a means of qualifying to be present on the framework is that they can guarantee the"}
{"timestamp":"1:05:12","text":"capacity and capability to hmrc and that it won't be diluted by engagements elsewhere"}
{"timestamp":"1:05:18","text":"with the other government departments so I guess there's a big forecasting job to"}
{"timestamp":"1:05:23","text":"be done for what those sorts of levels might be as other government departments start to adopt the Dallas model as part"}
{"timestamp":"1:05:30","text":"of their future plans and obviously the mechanism for a continued competition throughout the life of the framework"}

{"timestamp":"1:06:06","text":"more we'll be able to respond in an agile way to the emerging situations that develop Jillian referred before to"}
{"timestamp":"1:06:12","text":"how the covert schemes really created a challenge for hmrc and it's quite"}

{"timestamp":"1:06:54","text":"general election before the end of 2024 who knows it may even be sooner and again we could see Focus shifts again so"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:00","text":"we need to be in a position to respond in an agile way to those to those to those things"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:08","text":"so in terms of direct Awards we've already mentioned the tiered taxi Rank and it's tiered for a reason now if we"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:13","text":"have three value tiers it essentially means that no one supplier gets all the big chunky work one and other suppliers"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:19","text":"get all the the crumbs that get wiped off the table everyone gets a chance to rotate through those through those lists"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:27","text":"and when we make the awards the way we plan"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:33","text":"to structure these is that for the highest value taxi rank the supplier"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:38","text":"placed first in the list will become supplier one in the highest value suppliers Place second will be in first"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:44","text":"in the medium value and the supplier Place third will be first in the low"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:49","text":"value and then the rotation will happen on that order so"}
{"timestamp":"1:07:55","text":"the information's on the slide they're about direct Awards again we'll be circulating these so I don't plan to"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:01","text":"read them in more detail one thing that's important to point out though is that within procurement legislation"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:07","text":"there is a a bias a Prejudice shall we say towards competition"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:12","text":"so where something would normally be within one of the taxi ranks or"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:18","text":"purchasable through a service catalog hmrc would retain the rate and the option to compete that but the opposite"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:25","text":"isn't true if something would normally be within the competition sphere we can't turn it into a direct award"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:30","text":"opportunity so just to make that clear and we've got our next slide"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:36","text":"many competitions we've already mentioned the extra detail here is that the due diligence that we'll be running to a point suppliers in the first place"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:43","text":"is going to be critical to us doing that fast turnaround and the mechanisms actually going to"}
{"timestamp":"1:08:48","text":"going to enable our customer groups and platform teams to deploy those rapid sourcing models and using a lighter"}

{"timestamp":"1:09:22","text":"trailed before the fact that we've had awful trouble working out exactly how we can create a situation in which we can"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:28","text":"transfer risk while still having suppliers work together and we went back and forth on this for"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:35","text":"weeks and weeks and weeks thinking how do we force suppliers to do this and then one day the light bulb went on"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:42","text":"and we thought why why are we thinking about forcing suppliers to do anything rather than incentivizing suppliers to"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:48","text":"do something so what we're planning to develop as part of this process is a contract"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:53","text":"management mechanism where there will be kpi measurements based upon"}
{"timestamp":"1:09:58","text":"collaboration with suppliers within the lots that this applies to so predominantly we would look at this"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:04","text":"being watch two and four but if you imagine a world in which"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:10","text":"you're assigned to deliver a work package and you have kpis linked to that work"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:17","text":"package and you can deliver that entirely with yourself or your own supplier team"}

{"timestamp":"1:10:30","text":"all of the things that you've delivered and all of that's fine because it works for hmrc but against those kpis you would never"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:37","text":"score more than 60 percent out of 100 percent"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:43","text":"if you then brought in individuals from other supplier teams you can start to score 70 or 80 or 90 the extent to which"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:52","text":"you support other suppliers and their deliveries could take you up to 100 potentially and unlocking those stage"}
{"timestamp":"1:10:59","text":"points has the potential then to unlock not just the performance incentives of"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:04","text":"being placed really high in a league table that we will keep which you can then report on to other government"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:09","text":"departments when you're going through your bidding processes but potentially also unlock Financial incentives too"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:15","text":"that would make it worth the while of suppliers to involve individuals from other organizations"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:21","text":"why would we want to do that well part of it is about transferring risk but part of it is about giving us the"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:26","text":"opportunity to say okay you've taken that risk you've taken the extra King Shilling so to speak"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:33","text":"so any issues that exists between yourselves and other suppliers within that group are your issues rather than"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:40","text":"our issues as a consequence of that extra incentivization being part of the"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:46","text":"agreement but the real benefit for us is the fact that we've come from a world in which"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:51","text":"we've had a huge amount of dependence on just one or two suppliers we don't ever want to go back there"}
{"timestamp":"1:11:57","text":"and that's not to say anything about those suppliers who are wonderful suppliers but as an organization it"}

{"timestamp":"1:13:04","text":"and because of the fact that generally speaking all of the intellectual property is produced"}

{"timestamp":"1:26:59","text":"just um numbers at Birmingham we're using CCS offices in Birmingham so there will be"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:06","text":"limited numbers of supplier attendees um per supplier three so so just three"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:13","text":"three supplies for each of the sessions okay"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:20","text":"thank you"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:26","text":"thanks so much uh for that presentation uh Phil I don't know if you want to come up uh to field any questions that we"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:33","text":"have we're now moving on to uh question and answer session we have quite a few"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:39","text":"on slido at the minute actually quite a few have been answered as the as the"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:44","text":"presentations have gone on so um so I'll sort of maybe take this"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:49","text":"opportunity to go through a very popular one that may or may not"}
{"timestamp":"1:27:55","text":"be controversial but I'll ask it anyway it says um as Philip said yet another framework are you saying that none of"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:02","text":"the existing Frameworks uh to supply these project skills and roles are exist"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:07","text":"already including the new DSP essentially why why do we need this one on top of what we already have"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:16","text":"oh sorry um Ali could you sorry"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:32","text":"yeah it's a really good question I'm sure Michael have a perspective on this too but essentially what we're not"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:38","text":"saying as a result of this framework is that there are not some excellent Frameworks already in existence with ccs"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:44","text":"what those Frameworks don't do however is allow us to achieve some of the things we want to achieve as a result of"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:52","text":"uh putting Dallas in place so we talked about ongoing competitive tension we"}
{"timestamp":"1:28:57","text":"talked about information sharing we talked about the opportunities for very rapid competition"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:03","text":"we can only really do those things in the the setting of having a framework that has a smaller number of suppliers"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:10","text":"on each of the Lots where those suppliers are become familiar and develop Partnerships with us in a very"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:17","text":"rapid period of time so that they can understand how we do business and by virtue of those things enable us to have"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:23","text":"those quick competition turnarounds in four to six weeks to respond with agility to the things that develop so"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:29","text":"whilst there are some exceptional Frameworks in place that covers some of these things they don't do them in quite"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:35","text":"the way we need to move forward within hmrc and there are a number of other departments as Mike mentioned before"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:40","text":"that are in precisely the same boat and are looking to use some of the principles that we're trying to introduce here but Mike did you want to"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:48","text":"adjust on that yeah just to add to that that you know part of the early days of this program we we challenged each other"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:54","text":"hmrc and CCS around what Frameworks could align and how could we align those"}
{"timestamp":"1:29:59","text":"Frameworks and and make their work for what hmrc were wanting to deliver and"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:05","text":"wanted to get out of it and what we come to is that actually there is no perfect scenario for us and this actually helps"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:12","text":"us and when we talk to other customers this is also an effective mechanism to help them as well"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:18","text":"I think just to add as well that hmrc has always been quite aware of the fact that we're a bit of a canary in a coal"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:24","text":"mine on this particular one because if some of the principles and mechanisms"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:29","text":"that we're looking to introduce actually work well and have the utility to start to scale across other government"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:35","text":"departments there are things here that could become much more commonplace within CCS Frameworks of the future and"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:41","text":"there's already deliberations happening in relation to tech services four I understand to start to think about how"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:46","text":"that could be shaped with some of the principles that we're looking to introduce here yes definitely"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:52","text":"um new regulations coming in next year for us as well maybe help move things along so again we're thinking of you"}
{"timestamp":"1:30:59","text":"know thinking of models that help our customers um going forward thanks Mike"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:06","text":"thanks are there any questions in the room anybody in the room have a question"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:13","text":"uh Julia we have a question we just need the mic so that those online can also"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:18","text":"hear as well so yeah if right down in the front here Julia could you just as you ask me a question if you could at"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:24","text":"least your name in which organization did you raise your hand so Juliet thank you"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:30","text":"let's see um can you mentioned that um"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:43","text":"so we can expand a little but obviously the um the ITT packs aren't going to be"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:48","text":"going out until February so there's still some more development to be done and some of that development will actually happen as a consequence of some"}
{"timestamp":"1:31:55","text":"of the conversations that we have in Birmingham at the end of the month because as has been mentioned we don't want to close the book on the art of the"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:01","text":"possible if there's something that can genuinely help us proposition that we have here"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:06","text":"um but the essentially what we were thinking about is that in lot 2A and 4A where we have"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:14","text":"larger suppliers we would set a mechanism whereby if the profit margin that was generated from"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:20","text":"the framework exceeded 25 then in bandings above 25 percent it would be"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:26","text":"possible to remit a percentage of the excess profit above 25 into Innovation"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:32","text":"funds and those Innovation funds would then enable us to fund things like the"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:38","text":"facilitated citizen coder sessions or potentially prototyping activity that may come into"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:44","text":"the the area of lot one so that's that's the broad principle that we're looking to apply but the exact bandings and what"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:50","text":"the values are on there we haven't settled on yet"}
{"timestamp":"1:32:56","text":"another question here"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:02","text":"thanks Holly thanks so much Chris Farthing advice Cloud um if an SME was to apply uh directly"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:08","text":"for the lots of relevant for can they also still apply for the supply chain ones as well as in going going alongside"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:13","text":"with the big boys absolute PS um yeah there's also some some advantage in"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:21","text":"that I would I would suggest because it enables uh greater opportunity to flex across different lots for some views"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:28","text":"possible so we're definitely Keen to encourage encourage that the only"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:33","text":"restriction that we're actually making is that you cannot Supply on both lot 4A"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:39","text":"and 4B as the same lead supplier um and lot 2A and 2B so it applies on"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:46","text":"both of those both of those parts of the framework"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:51","text":"anymore oh Julia"}
{"timestamp":"1:33:58","text":"hi it's uh Rob Malcolm from dxc I've got a process question if that's okay in"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:04","text":"terms of the SQ itself the intent of the SQ I assume is to down select the number"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:09","text":"of supplies to take forward to the ITT could you just describe that process and how many you were expecting to take"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:16","text":"through to that next phase and then if you could just further expand on how many you supplies to expect to see on"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:22","text":"each lot at the end of the process many thanks so we may actually be able to get the slide back potentially which"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:29","text":"identifies how many suppliers were intending to appoint to each of the lots for the SQ phase you are absolutely"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:36","text":"right it's it's being used to narrow the list down so that it doesn't become too great a an evaluation headache for the"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:44","text":"department and for CCS because with something this new um if we were to end up having to plow through hundreds and"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:51","text":"hundreds of tenders then it could potentially delay us from a timeline point of view and hmrc is very much on"}
{"timestamp":"1:34:57","text":"the clock with this because we're looking to try and get it in at a time roughly around the expiry of the initial"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:03","text":"terms of some existing contracts so that that's what's driving some of those decisions but broadly speaking we're"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:10","text":"looking to down select to double the number of suppliers that we intend to"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:16","text":"appoint to the framework a lot now there may be one or two variations around that particularly if you end up with unlock"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:22","text":"one for example the suppliers that are our 10th and 11th on the list if they score identically then we would probably"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:28","text":"take them through on an identical score but generally we will set the set the"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:34","text":"level and and cut off everything below that level but broadly speaking we're aiming for double double the figures"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:39","text":"that you see on the screen there"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:45","text":"hi uh Ed development Triad just carry on from Chris's question as an SME we will"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:50","text":"be able to apply with other Primes in the same lot if that makes sense thanks"}
{"timestamp":"1:35:57","text":"so just to understand the question then so if there are five primes in lot 2A"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:03","text":"yes could we join or apply with several primes within the same lot"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:09","text":"yeah absolutely um I mean obviously the there will be"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:14","text":"um conversations and discussions that you will enter into with those primes about the nature of the working"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:20","text":"agreement that would exist between you but we would want to place no constraint on any supply chain members from"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:28","text":"operating with with multiple suppliers across those lots so I suppose technically you could end up as a as a"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:34","text":"supplier for five of the lead suppliers within one of the lots and also as a direct supplier in the B part of the lot"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:40","text":"which um for smes might maximize your opportunity to uh to generate business"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:46","text":"um but obviously um we've talked a lot about capacity we've talked a lot about capability and"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:52","text":"that is important to us and so I think the openness that we're looking to develop in the partnership"}
{"timestamp":"1:36:58","text":"arrangements with the suppliers would necessitate a situation where we would"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:04","text":"have to have fairly robust conversations if suppliers were bite enough more than they could chew"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:10","text":"and likewise I think when we come to qualifying suppliers to be appointed to"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:16","text":"the Lots we will be looking at Financial standings to just determine whether or not they would be capable of at very"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:22","text":"least meeting the type of minimum workshare commitments that we would be proposing for the lot"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:29","text":"thanks I will take another question that came in on online"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:35","text":"um there's a question about will there be any situation where you may still procure via other Frameworks such as dos"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:41","text":"or gcloud so I think the quick answer to that is we we wouldn't want to constrain"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:47","text":"ourselves so whatever options are available we'll do an analysis a commercial analysis and"}
{"timestamp":"1:37:52","text":"determine what the best route to Market is from a strategic point of view for hmrc it would make sense for us wherever"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:00","text":"possible to put as much work through the Dallas framework as possible and there's no loss to CCS from that either because"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:06","text":"obviously being a CCS framework it attracts the levy so whenever we spend through this becomes a virtuous circle"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:13","text":"for all of government in terms of spend under management but as things start to"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:19","text":"move forward you may start to see the other forays into the market that hmrc has"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:24","text":"made in things like data and sap start to unify under this type of approach in"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:30","text":"future iterations too another one uh from online"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:37","text":"um Can hmrc facilitate introductions or contact sharing for a larger primes and"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:42","text":"interested smes Mike do you want to take that"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:50","text":"yeah so CCs is uh kindly volunteered to facilitate those arrangements okay"}
{"timestamp":"1:38:55","text":"thanks [Music] um could you please list the distinct nine"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:02","text":"Technologies so the nine Technologies are on the slide deck which is okay CCS website but"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:09","text":"um I'm Testament memory now but the Pega systems Microsoft Dynamics Microsoft"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:14","text":"Power Platform Office 365 apps Kong document um nice"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:19","text":"and sap yes so"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:26","text":"well done thank you there's a question at the back hello there Chris Gallagher"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:31","text":"confluent I'm looking at the annual values and the number of suppliers the primes are still going to have to be fairly large I would"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:37","text":"argue because they are they're large annual values right will you be spelling out what a good Prime will look like I'm"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:46","text":"not saying names but what good would look like if you see what I mean because I think that would be extremely useful thank you interestingly the um I"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:54","text":"mentioned before about the work stream that we've just set up and Rich may want to talk a little bit more about this in"}
{"timestamp":"1:39:59","text":"a moment but um we've just set up a work stream looking at um a a broad brush picture of what we're"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:06","text":"looking for from suppliers both in terms of the characteristics of the supplier the capacity their capability their"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:12","text":"ability to work in partnership with us their ability to collaborate with other suppliers and the types of"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:20","text":"um activities they would be expected to deliver deliver and the standard kpi sets that would apply to all of the"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:25","text":"suppliers in certain lots that that is happening as we speak um so hopefully that will address an"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:31","text":"awful lot of the the content of the question there but I'm happy to hand over to"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:37","text":"sorry Rick"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:42","text":"thank you smiling advice card again um to mind uh this is going to be services-based"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:48","text":"procurement isn't it you're not looking for the supplier to actually Supply the technology as well are you no it's it's"}
{"timestamp":"1:40:54","text":"purely Services based and I mean obviously it was it was covered in the presentation that over time there will"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:00","text":"be a shift away from coding toward configuration so those technologies will"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:06","text":"already exist as either platform as a service or software as a service and then the services will be work packages"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:12","text":"involved in configuring those services for specific um use cases"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:19","text":"thanks um I'll take one from from online how will hmrc integrate social value in such"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:26","text":"a large and long framework I think that's a to be concluded"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:33","text":"so there will definitely be detailed information when it comes to the um the ITT stage"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:39","text":"what we've done on this in the past though is we've focused on four action themes generally which are to do with"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:45","text":"well-being societal impact uh equality and we've previously looked at covert"}
{"timestamp":"1:41:50","text":"recovery and particularly the impact on local communities when it comes to code recovery but that's less of a a"}

{"timestamp":"1:42:43","text":"so it's a good question and it came up repeatedly during the tsp um procurements that we did"}
{"timestamp":"1:42:50","text":"I think the short answer is that we wouldn't want to constrain ourselves when it comes to opportunities but there"}

{"timestamp":"1:43:32","text":"offshore data so all data is in the UK but we we wouldn't say no never to other things"}

{"timestamp":"1:45:29","text":"um it's impossible for us to state that with any certainty but broadly speaking what we're looking to do is allocate on"}

{"timestamp":"1:47:07","text":"those initial terms expire we'll be looking as early as possible to move them into this structure"}
{"timestamp":"1:47:15","text":"thanks will suppliers be expected to provide people to work on the customer site or"}
{"timestamp":"1:47:21","text":"is remote working allowed so we've switched to virtually all remote working within hmrc now following"}
{"timestamp":"1:47:28","text":"covid um and we we don't anticipate that changing markedly but obviously there"}
{"timestamp":"1:47:34","text":"will be requirements at times to attend in person and and they would be uh detailed in the the statements of work"}

{"timestamp":"1:47:50","text":"hi Clive Friedman from log point my question is not so much about the framework but more about the drivers so"}
{"timestamp":"1:47:56","text":"in your presentation you talk I saw at least 1500 contractors and I'm sure"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:01","text":"there's many multiples more in hmrc what would good look like as a result of this in terms of the contractors given that"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:08","text":"the contractors also have the corporate memory of hmrc and the objective is to move in-house what would be the position"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:16","text":"of looking at those contractors as potentials for assisting in whether it"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:22","text":"be SME or into Indie primes to tap"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:29","text":"well certainly for anyone who wanted to bed we wouldn't discourage contacting"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:34","text":"the organizations that are in hmrc operating today because an Institutional memory may well be useful in helping you"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:41","text":"to create bids and subsequently to deliver services I think ultimately in terms of what good"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:47","text":"would look like and what we're trying to achieve it's very much about that shift towards intelligent clients and again"}
{"timestamp":"1:48:53","text":"I'll give Rich the opportunity to come in on that one possibly uh yes I think that this part about moving"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:00","text":"to intelligent clients um and but I think the framework is about really shifting to outcome pieces of work being"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:05","text":"able to contract uh for outcomes and taking smaller more self-contained piece"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:12","text":"of work within that ecosystem of Partners on the framework which which is part of that journey and being able to"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:18","text":"separate the work and deliver work in small in small chunks is is really part of delivering that strategy uh for hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:27","text":"so retaining that knowledge the intelligent client knowledge in-house but having that ecosystem of Partners to"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:32","text":"deliver those outcomes for us through a a flexible framework"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:37","text":"and I think um our cdio dalgia it's been on record as effectively saying about"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:43","text":"how we as an organization need to balance better how we work with the market so whilst the intelligent client"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:49","text":"improves on our side of the house there would be more opportunities for us to put things out to the market that we"}
{"timestamp":"1:49:55","text":"currently do today largely using contingent labor or in some case of"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:01","text":"resource-based contracts with suppliers rather than outcome-based ones that we're looking to move towards here"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:09","text":"I'm very conscious by the way that there's been very few technical questions and we've got Jillian and Rich"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:14","text":"and Dean sat waiting with baited breath for any technical questions so if you do have them"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:21","text":"I don't this probably doesn't qualify as a technical questions of apologies but um"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:27","text":"it was mentioned that there will be open book requirements can you please expand on this"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:33","text":"um it's a standard within all government contracts that generally we would um require suppliers to submit to open"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:40","text":"book uh costing and for us to have um open book reviews periodically that we"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:45","text":"can commission it's not a given that we will commission them but that we could commission"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:51","text":"um I think in the Lots where we would be looking at gain share as a means of funding Innovation it would be more"}
{"timestamp":"1:50:57","text":"likely that we would assert that right perhaps more frequently but yeah it would be as as it is in"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:04","text":"other government contracts where we get that level of detail to enable us to understand the impact that Dallas"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:10","text":"Activity is having on the uh the bottom line for your organization"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:16","text":"thank you is there a detailed list of services or"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:21","text":"Pipeline and how they map to each of the Lots this may help suppliers prioritize the most appropriate Lots"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:29","text":"so what we have at the moment is a list of contracts that are directly within"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:34","text":"the scope of Dallas and we're in the process through a work stream of building exactly that details of the the"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:40","text":"types of work packages that will exist and how they map to to the various Lots"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:45","text":"within the framework so that will be made available at the ITT stage"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:50","text":"this is uh good morning my name's Robbie I'm"}
{"timestamp":"1:51:57","text":"from cloud Source I'll ask a certainly cool question um for lot four you thanks for like"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:03","text":"naming the technologies that you want suppliers to provide I'm curious though"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:09","text":"to try and differentiate my organization whether we bid in lot 2B or in lot 4B"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:16","text":"um lot to be a lot lot twos about digital services so what what outcomes"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:22","text":"are you looking to generate in lot for so the difference fundamentally is that"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:28","text":"in Lot 2 the the digital build services that will be"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:34","text":"aligned to the digital delivery centers to borders and trade and for Enterprise Integration will be largely done on a"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:41","text":"devsecops Model but using um code of codable technology so things"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:47","text":"like scalar and Java and and some of the uh various other technologies that Jillian mentioned in her presentation"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:53","text":"the difference with Lot 4 is that it's all focused on configurable technology"}
{"timestamp":"1:52:58","text":"and so anything that comes into that sphere of being a configurable product"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:04","text":"or platform either from the list that we've provided earlier or get added to later on will automatically slot into"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:11","text":"Lot 4 and be configured rather than coded thank you"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:17","text":"another one from online how does the low code no code platform strategy affect"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:23","text":"how current Digital Services that are bespoke or code developed in the future will that change"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:30","text":"so rich do you wanna um so I think if uh from from Tom's"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:36","text":"Video the future is to move to a a much more of a platform uh based architecture"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:43","text":"building on top of that primarily you're trying to use low code and no code Solutions as much as possible but I"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:50","text":"think as as this was was trailed up front this is part of a longer journey to move from from a lot of Legacy"}
{"timestamp":"1:53:57","text":"systems so we're going to be shifting that architecture over a period of time so um that will that will be part of the"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:04","text":"digital Journey that hmrc goes on uh ideally we'll we'll introduce more and more of those Loco Technologies as we go"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:12","text":"along but we have to understand where we're starting from um and need to build on that so so it allows us to evolve to that state of"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:19","text":"over over the next few years I think from a commercial perspective as"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:25","text":"well just to build on that you'll notice from the annual values that have been cited on the screen in front of you that"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:31","text":"there is more money currently focused on the digital development side of things than there is on the configurable side"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:37","text":"of things um what will happen over time is that we will start to see a shift of money and"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:44","text":"potentially it might be iteration two or whatever the successor for Dallas becomes we'll start to see money more"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:50","text":"money shift into the configurable platforms than we see today um but within the life cycle of this"}
{"timestamp":"1:54:56","text":"framework and possibly even within the life cycle of its successor we're not going to get away from doing scholar and"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:03","text":"Java stack coding deployed on our multi-channel digital tax platform those services will still exist it's"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:10","text":"just that more there'll be a greater preponderance into Lot 4 over time"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:17","text":"foreign okay um well Pega documentum development work"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:26","text":"be a part of this framework absolutely yes"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:34","text":"is there a specified security clearance per lot"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:39","text":"so it's not specified per lot it's more specified on the basis of the type of work that's being done so generally any"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:46","text":"work that involves use of live data requires SC clearance uh where there's no live data involved unless there's"}
{"timestamp":"1:55:52","text":"something specific that requires it to be have a higher security classification generally bpss is sufficient"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:01","text":"to say again that your framework level dependent hmrc may call it off in their"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:06","text":"in their call off contracts other customers May utilize and ask for different things so it's it's going to"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:12","text":"be as and when required the school off"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:18","text":"can you confirm the criteria to be used to assess a supplier as an SME what if"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:23","text":"the organization grows beyond this definition during the framework period"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:29","text":"So the appointment is made at the start of the framework and so the supplier would remain on the framework within"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:35","text":"that lot for the period of the framework in terms of the definition of SMA cabinet office has a specific definition"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:41","text":"which relates to the amount of employees and the turnover but it's specific to"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:47","text":"um its operation as a worldwide entity so for example an organization may be an"}
{"timestamp":"1:56:54","text":"SME according to the numbers but if they have an overseas parent they can't be an SME technically because"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:01","text":"the parent can provide company guarantees or access to wider market capitalization"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:11","text":"here we go Julia well it's for the people online so that they can hear you as well"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:18","text":"so it's David I'm from Lidos again um to what extent are the is the SQ"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:25","text":"going to be set against hmrc's criteria as opposed"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:31","text":"to the criteria that may reflect other departments requirements"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:36","text":"at the moment and I'm sure Michael uh come in if I get any of this wrong but"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:41","text":"at the moment we're jointly developing the SQ with ccs so that there will be a"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:46","text":"flavor for both so hmrc's requirements will come into that but ccs are also"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:52","text":"having a major input into that content but as um Shannon and Miriam mentioned before our anticipation is that the SQ"}
{"timestamp":"1:57:59","text":"process is very much around looking backwards what are the skills capabilities experiences of you having"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:06","text":"delivered in organizations of a similar size and scale to hmrc in this kind of operation where"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:13","text":"there would be supplier collaboration greater information sharing all of those things were looking to test based on"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:18","text":"your experiences in the past and then when we get to ITT phase it's very much going to be about what are you"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:24","text":"going to do for us today and the Monty Python one of the Romans done for us lately kind of sense and the"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:31","text":"needs will be very similar whether it's hmrc or another department"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:36","text":"um they'll be very similar around what the criteria we're setting at the SQ level so it is CCS are leading that"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:44","text":"input from um from Phil and the team plus our other knowledge of what's going on there"}
{"timestamp":"1:58:54","text":"because I think that's a follow-up question Julia"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:02","text":"of course yes yeah we we recognize that it is but we think we'll be we'll work"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:09","text":"through enough that we'll get a a good balance which will work for the framework"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:18","text":"someone is asking um how many slots are available for the face-to-face one-to-one sessions"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:25","text":"so we've set aside enough capacity uh within the week in Birmingham to"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:31","text":"accommodate um around 100 suppliers okay during the course of that week we'll have"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:38","text":"um five five teams available but we can Flex up to six depending on uh uptake and as Mike mentioned before there's a"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:45","text":"limit of um three representatives for each supplier organization during that week but um it's uh it's an opportunity"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:53","text":"to to meet us face to face to ask us questions to make suggestions and hopefully uh we it can be a mutually"}
{"timestamp":"1:59:59","text":"beneficial Arrangement just to reiterate though any questions that we are asked in that setting we will be capturing and"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:05","text":"publishing as part of our responsibility to be fair and transparent to all of the bidders"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:14","text":"thank you is it worthwhile for hmrc to consider large-scale Enterprise Integration"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:19","text":"Services as a dedicated lot separate to although joined up to product development"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:28","text":"we have considered that as a commercial approach But ultimately we landed on the"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:34","text":"fact that our technology journey is very much around working to configurable platforms and"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:41","text":"products so it becomes more about products than it does about lines of business and about lines of service and"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:48","text":"that's that's how we decided to structure the the framework I I guess it's um there's no wrong answer as to"}
{"timestamp":"2:00:55","text":"how you would want to structure it but because we want to take that product centered approach in the way that we take the transformation forward it"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:01","text":"seemed to be the most sensible split"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:07","text":"could you please confirm the SQ date is it the 6th of October"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:13","text":"with a 30-day return I.E mid-november yeah yeah the 30-day"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:18","text":"um is statutory we we give 30 days for the return of the SQ"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:23","text":"okay which clouds are hmrc using and expecting to use will product vendor"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:29","text":"clouds also be used servicenow for example or Pega cloud"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:38","text":"so today at hmrc in terms of infrastructure as a service predominantly uses AWS and"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:46","text":"azure um but as Tom raised in his presentation we want to over time move more away from"}
{"timestamp":"2:01:53","text":"iwas into platform as a service and software as a service so that wouldn't necessitate the actual vendor software"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:01","text":"being served from their side of the firewall into our side of the firewall"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:06","text":"and then configured on our side of the firewall"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:12","text":"will there be will bespoke performance certificates be required to prove skills"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:18","text":"and experience in developments I think is the the way"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:24","text":"to answer that we will come out with more detail on that but we're working through what that would need to look like when it comes to the um the Itt"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:31","text":"okay and just going back oh sorry there's a question in the room"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:41","text":"you just triggered a question in my head here so um Sarah talked about the university that you have in cdia which I"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:47","text":"think is you know really fundamental to build your skills yet I don't see a"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:53","text":"budget allocation to that particular task is is there a budget associated with building that out"}
{"timestamp":"2:02:59","text":"and where would it fit within the Lots so there isn't a a single specified"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:07","text":"budget as such today you'll have noticed from the the last instructor Slide the expanded one that had um detail on it I"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:14","text":"think there's about 15 million pounds allocated in total two lot five um which again is a forecast on what we"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:21","text":"think we will spend but the way that spend is taken up is largely through commissioning by individual parts of the"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:28","text":"cdio organization who will commission a particular Academy to suit their needs"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:34","text":"so for example David Cooper is the primary user of Pega resources so David"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:40","text":"May commission the creation of a Pega Academy on an ongoing basis and it makes"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:46","text":"sense for us in some ways to almost industrialize that as a process so that as one"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:51","text":"the next one comes through so that we have that constant throughput of Staff because we know we lose them out of the"}
{"timestamp":"2:03:56","text":"door as quickly as we've trained them because we can't pay them enough but that industrialization of that"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:02","text":"process means we'll get to retain more of them potentially just because they love us because we're fantastic people"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:07","text":"to work but the the volume will start to shape"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:13","text":"the market too over time as we have more and more skilled individuals in those in those areas"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:19","text":"um so whilst I wouldn't say there's a fixed budget we're forecasting that there's about 15 million pounds that will be"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:25","text":"allocated to the the technology skills academies and the production of the um"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:30","text":"the 12-week cross training course as that would result in a nano degree so as our existing staff start to move away"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:37","text":"from Legacy Technologies they can be trained on the Strategic technologies that are being introduced into the business"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:43","text":"hopefully that answers it I think so of course uh did you want to"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:50","text":"come in about to come in did you want to come in on that Sarah it's going to say I mean we we obviously"}
{"timestamp":"2:04:56","text":"do a lot of work on a business as usual basis as well so this isn't just about"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:02","text":"um you know creating capability or learning opportunities for new stuff but"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:07","text":"this is about existing staff as well about really utilizing the talent that we already have in cdio because yes we"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:15","text":"are a fantastic place to work and I think we're making it even better you know we've we've got a great learning"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:21","text":"and career development offer now in cdio and it's really about building that out"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:26","text":"so that um you know it is about then retaining more of our internal talent but also"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:33","text":"really leverage in our talent as well I think we have Sarah thank you thank"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:39","text":"you Sarah uh there's a question in the room oh hi it's uh Natalie Gray from"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:46","text":"co-durance here I was just wondering more about the one-to-one sessions in Birmingham just wondering like how long"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:52","text":"are they and do suppliers that have made the effort to come and see you in Birmingham get more points or yeah just"}
{"timestamp":"2:05:58","text":"wondering how it works can I just um um follow on because we have a couple questions online related so you can take"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:04","text":"them all together so um where there's a question about whether there's an agenda for the face-to-face and whether the"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:11","text":"market engagement days are multi-supplier or individual supplier meetings so if you could take those"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:17","text":"so the events will be individual one-to-one so each supplier will"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:22","text":"individually be able to meet with a joint team from ccs and hmrc during those Market engagement sessions"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:29","text":"there will be no points allocated to attending face-to-face I think we would struggle to get that one past the lawyers"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:35","text":"um but the the opportunity that there will be no agenda because it's an opportunity for you as suppliers to have"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:41","text":"digested everything that you've heard today reviewed the packs and come to us with any further questions that you"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:47","text":"might have one of the things that we found throughout tsp is that some of these events have been naturally limited"}
{"timestamp":"2:06:54","text":"I guess in the questions that have been asked and sometimes that's just about"}

{"timestamp":"2:07:05","text":"with you so having the opportunity to ask that in an anonymized setting where"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:10","text":"nobody knows who's asked what question when it gets published we anticipated would give us greater opportunity to"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:17","text":"have more open dialogue in terms of the timing we're planning to allocate 45 minutes to each supplier for those"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:23","text":"face-to-face sessions does that cover all of the aspects of"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:30","text":"I think so I great all right"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:36","text":"let's see how are you thinking about content expertise versus Raw DDOT skills as you"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:43","text":"award lots for example Customs borders requires specialist knowledge to build good services"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:51","text":"um I guess that's probably one more for Jillian and Dean to perhaps take between"}
{"timestamp":"2:07:57","text":"them foreign yeah someone can help with that so"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:02","text":"we need people who understand the technologies that we're building in we need people with the skills"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:09","text":"um for example and obviously is sort of Bas and that sort of thing and Technical"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:14","text":"Architects the Customs knowledge because there are two sorts of technicals in our"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:20","text":"world the Customs knowledge comes from our selves so we have a a pool what we call it a"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:26","text":"large pool but a pool of subject matter experts we have a depth of knowledge inside cdio borders and trade so this is"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:34","text":"what I really mean by it's that combination of internals and externals"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:39","text":"um you know at the end of it I mean partners that we work with become subject matter experts in that narrow"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:46","text":"field but we wouldn't expect you to come with deep knowledge of CPC code 2783 for"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:53","text":"example okay that's not going to happen there only are a handful of people in the entire world"}
{"timestamp":"2:08:59","text":"um well that we could have at access to does that help"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:05","text":"I think so yes thanks Dean Jillian was there anything you would like to add there uh same as Dean from a digital"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:11","text":"platform point of view I mean obviously we do more than just the borders and trade program we've got multiple"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:17","text":"programs and platform team and again you know we've just transitioned from a number of suppliers still"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:23","text":"um who didn't come in with deep hmrc knowledge but we have the intelligent client Leo within the digital platform"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:30","text":"team who are the hmrc permanent staff as well as the subject matter experts from"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:35","text":"the business that were with us in programs and projects that we deliver excellent and I think just to expand"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:42","text":"that a little bit further because of the fact that this is going to be a cross-government framework it'll be up"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:47","text":"to each department that uses the framework to Define for themselves where the boundary lies between what they want related to content and ddat"}
{"timestamp":"2:09:57","text":"you have one down in the front"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:05","text":"um what framework terms are going to be used for the contract framework Public Service public sector"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:11","text":"contracts what they'd be based on right so the the framework itself is being developed from the"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:18","text":"um the cabinet's office public sector I.T Services contract"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:24","text":"um and it will be augmented with specific content based on the things"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:29","text":"that we've discussed today now some things are at this moment open to discussion as to how they land and I"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:35","text":"think Michael will be able to say a little bit more on that but so when we land it it'll be clear as to what"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:41","text":"information sits at the framework level what sits within a department-specific"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:46","text":"service specification and what sits within a a call off contract potentially even an enduring call-off contract for"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:53","text":"the suppliers appointed that we can then start to commission statements of work from"}
{"timestamp":"2:10:58","text":"I think we're getting into more of a you know horses for courses scenario within ccs and making sure that we have the"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:04","text":"right contract for the right Lots so we are looking at that and making sure that we have the right terms with each to"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:11","text":"support each of the types of activity that are going on so I'm not going to say now it's going to be one because"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:16","text":"because it may be different types as we have in tier three um so just it will be what we think and"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:23","text":"when we go through what will support the framework other customers and suppliers best"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:29","text":"organizations it will be issued with the ITT with the Itt yeah they'll go out in the acting"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:36","text":"not with the SQ no they'll go out with the Itt"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:42","text":"which is normal thank you"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:49","text":"another question going back to the cloud question for a minute so given that there's an expectation to broaden Beyond"}
{"timestamp":"2:11:55","text":"AWS in azira what is hmrc's strategic and Technology posture on multi-cloud"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:05","text":"so I think as Tom covered in his video uh the shift to the shift to a uh"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:11","text":"platforms and services trying to consume them as services so particularly software as a service um and platform as"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:17","text":"a service will will it inevitably mean that and and consuming them in a way you"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:23","text":"know in a um working from that vend from the core product and only customizing as required"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:30","text":"is will inevitably end up with uh multiple uh Solutions being provided"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:35","text":"across that so so as Phil talked about we have we already have um infrastructure a lot of our"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:42","text":"infrastructures on cloud services but as we adopt more more of a platform-based architecture that will will lead to the"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:48","text":"adoption of more cloud services from different software providers thank you"}
{"timestamp":"2:12:55","text":"as more departments join the framework will they all share the same time"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:01","text":"or will each customer have their own so it will be for each customer to Define for themselves how what they want"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:08","text":"to adopt in relation to that yes it would be a call of specific and how they"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:13","text":"want to apply it or if they want to apply it it's not going to be dictated across the framework this could be a key"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:18","text":"principle of the call up that hmrc are using and just to look back around on"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:23","text":"that question about the framework because obviously there's some uncertainty there um we're running this as a restricted"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:30","text":"process specifically because we wanted to release this in waves because if we release the entire thing to the markets"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:36","text":"at once it will diminish the quality of what we are able to get back from the market so so consequently rather than"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:43","text":"having to those who might be interested in um applying to be on five Lots at once you wouldn't want to stretch your A-Team"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:50","text":"so thinly in such a short space of time but what that also enables us to do is"}
{"timestamp":"2:13:55","text":"to release the specific elements of that wave at the time of the wave now when"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:00","text":"the it the first ITT goes out um we will have details that cover the"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:05","text":"entire framework from end to end and then the ITT for wave one will be"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:11","text":"specific around the services that we'll be consuming in that wave and then similarly for wave two but the actual"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:17","text":"the legal side of the documents the the contractual Vehicles the framework the call of contracts they will be released"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:24","text":"as part of the ATT issuance for wave one"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:31","text":"yeah we we couldn't do that on open and that's where we one of the reasons we"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:37","text":"upped the touristry from codeurance and one of the themes uh"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:44","text":"this morning has been about operating on outcomes based uh contracts and supplies"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:50","text":"having skin in the game would those be don't understand correctly working on"}
{"timestamp":"2:14:55","text":"fixed price terms so again there are a number of commercial models that we could use for"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:01","text":"outcome-based contracts we're not necessarily tied to fixed price but um as well as fixed price you we could"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:07","text":"have models that are based on part fixed and part variable velocity incentivization models or or return on"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:13","text":"investment models so we plan as part of the hmrc specific elements of that to"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:18","text":"provide information to the markets as to the types of commercial models we would be looking to use with the options then"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:24","text":"available for us to put in place on a case-by-case basis just back up again back up to the"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:32","text":"framework level we're going to give the customers the option to use whatever is right for the project and for them at"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:37","text":"that point in time that they call off the work"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:44","text":"any more in the room no okay uh I think we'll we'll just take maybe"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:51","text":"one or two more questions uh maybe one from online once more to see if there's any in the room because they think we're"}
{"timestamp":"2:15:57","text":"sort of getting close to time now um"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:02","text":"I think which one shall I pick here how will you ensure that the sqs and ITT"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:08","text":"don't unintentionally end up a bias on the score for large incumbent suppliers of hmrc"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:17","text":"those who um participated in the processes that we followed under Tech sourcing program"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:23","text":"Tech Services Program will remember the um the steps that we took to level the"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:30","text":"playing field to the extent that actually um it was quite a a pleasant surprise to"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:37","text":"see new suppliers enter the HMR hmrc stable so hopefully with that experience"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:44","text":"it will be evident to the market that we're not specifically wedded to any"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:50","text":"specific supplier um any specific incumbent also the fact that we have framework"}
{"timestamp":"2:16:57","text":"Lots in which there are multiple opportunities to get onto the framework would in itself indicate that even if"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:04","text":"incumbent suppliers were to be successful throughout the process it's not just going to be the incumbent"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:09","text":"suppliers who are going to be on the lot and it's certainly not just incumbent suppliers that will be allocated work through that lot either on the taxi rank"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:17","text":"basis or through through competition so wherever possible we'll be looking to to"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:22","text":"level the playing field using those same mechanisms that we used in Tech sourcing program but one of the things that's important"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:28","text":"to say as well because this is a framework and not a contract we can't go into the specifics of exactly what that"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:34","text":"would mean when it comes to assessing transition costs and the 2p implications"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:40","text":"because we just don't know what they are now where um we're procuring for a framework rather"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:46","text":"than for a contract and when we start to put in place call-offs there will potentially be some of those call-offs"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:51","text":"where there are 2p implications and transition cost implications and we will start to provide information on those on"}
{"timestamp":"2:17:57","text":"a case-by-case basis but you could expect that it would follow the same sort of process that we've done in tsp"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:03","text":"where transition cost wouldn't be taken into account as part of the um the scoring of the bid"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:10","text":"and yes CCS running those and setting out the Esq and supporting the ITT"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:17","text":"aspect we will take the bias out of that and look at trying to get that Level Playing Field response we have no"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:24","text":"understanding of what's happening when we have an understanding but no detail around who the key suppliers are that"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:30","text":"that they need to keep or want to keep we'll just pull that back um and use it and buy it so you"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:37","text":"I think interestingly as well when we do the evaluations um the way we set up the evaluation"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:43","text":"teams that are often represented of some different parts of the organization so where you might have a supplier that"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:50","text":"could perhaps create some kind of unconscious bias for one evaluator in one part of the business about wanting"}
{"timestamp":"2:18:55","text":"to keep them that would absolutely be leveled off by the fact that there are multiple evaluators from multiple parts"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:01","text":"of the business you may have nothing to do with with that supplier so it's in"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:06","text":"some ways it's it's self-policing but it's also moderated as well by the commercial team to ensure any traces of"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:12","text":"bias are removed from the process however unconscious those traces of bias"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:18","text":"may be"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:23","text":"I will be able to answer the rest of the slider questions later on yes we're going to take those away and"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:29","text":"we'll create a spreadsheet with answers to all the questions and put them on the CCS website along with the the"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:35","text":"presentation deck I think I'll just take uh I'll take two"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:42","text":"more because one of them has been asked three times and then another one I think is is a bit"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:48","text":"more interesting so um when working remotely uh as just"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:53","text":"mentioned would there be a need to do so at secret classification"}
{"timestamp":"2:19:59","text":"I guess Julian and Dean may be able to provide a bit more information on this but generally not we don't do very much"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:06","text":"at secret classification but there are odd occasions where we do have certain interfaces with mod and one or two other"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:13","text":"organizations where that might happen but um yeah it would be definitely trailed and enough time given for"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:21","text":"suppliers to be able to get the accreditations necessary to operate at that level but um I guess so that the"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:28","text":"cross cross-government piece is exactly the same book level and the requirement of the"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:34","text":"customer there as when needed Jillian or Dean did or Rich I agree Phil no I agree"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:41","text":"um it would depend on the project if something came into that nature and we would give the supplier plenty of"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:47","text":"warning that that was happening but that's not the norm for what we do certainly in the digital platform team"}
{"timestamp":"2:20:53","text":"yeah or sensitive stuff we normally use as data isn't it really Jillian sorry didn't I cause across you then"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:00","text":"yeah yeah it it is I mean there's occasional bits and pieces with us there's certainly some secret data there"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:07","text":"are some secret um uh elements like risking"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:12","text":"um you know of goods uh for obvious reasons but again it would be with prior"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:18","text":"knowledge we wouldn't need the organization to be classified as that you know that we deal with it would be"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:23","text":"an individual level we'd give a lot of um notice about that and there's not a lot"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:30","text":"there is some but not a great deal foreign"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:36","text":"thanks Dean I think I'll take a final question here"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:42","text":"how much rating on prices will there be and how will pricing be scored in Itt"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:49","text":"so to be finalized we're still working on my level of detail and we'll work out how what's"}
{"timestamp":"2:21:55","text":"what's the importance of pricing uh across the pieces and work out how we can get the the best commercial value"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:02","text":"into into the framework early on to help all of our customers get even better"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:07","text":"commercial value going forward I mean just to expand on The hmrc View on that we we certainly have a"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:14","text":"perspective that as Lee set out at the beginning um the capacity capability and"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:19","text":"competition are more of the key features for us rather than price specifically"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:25","text":"but clearly price is important and given the economic pressures that exist now we"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:30","text":"understand that it's um it's going to be a challenge when bits are put in to maintain that competitiveness of pricing"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:37","text":"for the headline rate cards that that get produced but uh we will be looking"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:42","text":"to get the the highest quality solutions to uh to meet our needs at the the best"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:48","text":"possible price whilst recognizing that the cheapest isn't always the best"}
{"timestamp":"2:22:55","text":"great I'll just pause for any final from the room questions comments"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:02","text":"no one bar left on the microphone so"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:08","text":"okay great um you have promised there are more on slido that we I just just don't think we"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:14","text":"have enough time to get to everything but you guys will review those questions and provide the answers so rest assured"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:20","text":"that even if you didn't get to ask it or have it answered now they will be answered and addressed"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:26","text":"um I just want to I guess take a little bit of time to say thank you oh lee it"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:32","text":"looks like you're up to say thank you first"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:39","text":"yeah so just to wrap up um I just want to say thanks to Tech UK first of all for hosting and"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:45","text":"facilitating thank you for all of the speakers I hope you found that informative I've certainly learned some"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:52","text":"things about Dallas and hmrc from the last couple of hours I hope you all did as well and and most of all thank you"}
{"timestamp":"2:23:58","text":"all for attending both the people that have come in today as well as those online from all of the questions and"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:06","text":"thanks so much for the people to answering those to show a lot of interest and to be honest we're wasting our time like we don't get a lot of"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:12","text":"interest in this framework it's no good as suppliers don't want to be on it uh you've seen the next steps"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:18","text":"there is opportunity we do not have the Monopoly on good ideas we have time between now and October to hear your"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:26","text":"thoughts and feedback if you've got that there's a number of channels to reach out please take advantage of those"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:32","text":"one-to-one sessions we've learned from TSP that sometimes these open forums uh"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:38","text":"aren't always the best places to to get really good ideas so please if you're interested take up those one-to-one"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:45","text":"sessions and um yeah thanks again for this uh I think we'll be hanging around for about the next half hour or so so if"}
{"timestamp":"2:24:52","text":"anybody wants to say hello we will be here um and thanks again"}
{"timestamp":"2:25:00","text":"foreign just the final word of thanks from me uh"}
