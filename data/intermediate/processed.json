{"timestamp":"00:03:21","text":"hmrc we've been outsourced for a long long time and a lot of the knowledge has sat with third-party suppliers tsp is all about bringing the brain back in and so far what have we done we've done the disaggregation of the contracts but that's very much the start of tsp it is not what tsp is about so the disaggregation so far has been taking those big monolithic outsourced contracts and breaking them up into smaller contracts but what we've done is we've taken one of Monopoly contracts easy for me to say and we've broken them down into much smaller Monopoly contracts and we've done that for a couple of reasons the mature of hmrc didn't enable us to go from where we were to where we want to be in one jump and also we had time constraints to get us to where we needed to be so Dallas is going to provide us that next level of contract vehicle to get the maturity of hmrc to help build that intelligent client to help us take the"}
{"timestamp":"00:04:27","text":"applications and our services to the next level so there's three main aims of Dallas they all begin with C which makes it nice and easy to remember capability its capacity and its competition what Dallas aims to do is down select a smaller group of suppliers who will have the confidence that they are going to get significant work from hmrc so they are able to invest in hmrc really getting to know hmrc and provide the best quality of service to hmrc having multiple providers though gives us the best capacity I don't think I've ever known such squeeze on capacity as we have right now so relying on two smaller number of suppliers puts it at risk and I think we've just seen across lots of areas over the last 12 24 months how important diversity in the supply chain is and this will help us with that as well and then finally competition"}
{"timestamp":"00:05:34","text":"small number of suppliers that are pre-down selected means that we can keep competition helps Drive value for money or we can also do it quicker so instead of having to run procurements it takes months through the Dallas framework we should be able to turn things around in a matter of weeks so they're the three main drivers you'll get some more detail today and this is the first of of a whole string of of Market engagement so we really do want to hear your thoughts as well at the end of it we've got some questions but we also have follow-up sessions so I'm now going to hand over to Mike thank you Lee good morning all my name is Mike Hannan I'm the category lead within CCS for technology Services cyber and Technology transport and our my team will be looking after the Dallas framework and making sure that goes live yeah and we're really pleased to be working with hmrc as Philip said to get this off the road because we think it's a good good idea a good way of bringing"}
{"timestamp":"00:06:37","text":"in and changing the way the the Legacy services are developed and maintained okay just Sean to the next slide so this is what we think the the lighting structure looks like we're pretty sure this is about how we're going to look forward against a little bit more detail of the lot names and what goes through and and Phil we'll go through more of those in the level of detail why they're there for supported hmrc and clearly this is we've been talking to other government departments as well and they are looking to do something very similar to this so we're trying to build this so it's a capability that's available for all government departments okay so as as Lee said we're trying to look at the rationalize the number of suppliers across each of the lots to ensure that we got the the right suppliers in there the right competition the right capabilities to align those so you know we will go into further detail around that ecosystem it this more or less aligns"}
{"timestamp":"00:07:36","text":"to what are the type of suppliers we're looking for within those areas and and Phil again we'll go into more detail around what they look like and why we've got them there we just flip onto the next slide so I'm not going to go through all the level of details within there's a lot of detail on there but but effectively this is a design service aspect for lot one we're looking at the support and the delivery aspects for that design design activity okay until okay and this is the larger scale integration and development services so we're looking for large-scale organizations to support this these were very larger values across the the programs of activity hmrc will be putting out and we move on to 2B and these are the for the smaller SME level suppliers with this lower level lower value but you know still great capability that need to support hmrc and other Supply and other customers on okay lot three is integration and run"}

{"timestamp":"00:11:01","text":"so in the digital space for example digital development we had a situation where we had a very small number of suppliers who had to be assigned to do one particular piece of activity so we didn't have ongoing competitive tension and we struggled to adopt the GDs approach to Rainbow teams where you would have individuals from multiple suppliers working together to deliver the same types of things and when we have been able to do that with an hmrc what that's tended to mean is that you've had a hmrc person looking after that rainbow team and therefore the risk for delivery all stays with hmrc rather than being transferred into the market so we started off with that as a strategic problem and then started to build around this as to what the loss instructor should look like so as Mike's already pointed out we have some large-scale suppliers operating in the digital space today what we want to do is bolster that capability by bringing in opportunities for smaller suppliers smes of course but"}
{"timestamp":"00:12:02","text":"we're not being restrictive about that and in lap 2A and 2B one of the restrictions we are going to make is that if for the suppliers that bid they cannot be on both Lots so that will give us the opportunity to have a nice mix of both larger suppliers and smaller suppliers lot 3 which will also be delivered as part of the first wave of competition activity as Mike said is largely based on the Legacy run services that exist today so you will you will already know from TSP we've competed things like corporation tax we've competed things like child Benefit services and real-time information those services are going to be ultimately within that lot but you'll also see services that currently exist in borders and trade in that lot the services that we have retained with some incumbent suppliers that cover things like self-assessment that cover paye that cover banking services over time they will start to exit those contracts and will also drop into this framework as a means of procuring those"}
{"timestamp":"00:13:05","text":"services and when you think about the number of suppliers that we've we've put here as our aspiration that's very much focused on the point that Lee made about very rapid competition so what you can expect to see as we go through this process and we'll describe it in a bit more detail later in the presentation is to take steps to robustly pre-qualify the suppliers that we appoint on the basis of their capacity their capability their ability to work together with other suppliers and the reason we need that is because when we have a trusted supplier group we are then able to share much more information with that trusted supplier group with the best will in the world and for all of the wonderful things that CCS has done with their Frameworks it's impossible for us to be able to share the level of information that we have with 150 suppliers on tech services three or three thousand suppliers on dos if we have a smaller group of suppliers we can be much more open about our pipelines we could be much more open about our architecture about our"}
{"timestamp":"00:14:06","text":"Journeys about what's happening a year in advance when the plans crystallize what's happening three months in advance and that information sharing will enable suppliers to be better placed to respond toward a rapid competition approach so we're anticipating that once this lands we'll be able in a lot of cases particularly in Lots two and four to turn competitions around and around about four to six weeks so it's quite a move from where we are now where we average about 14 weeks for a Dos competition in about five months for a competition through tech services three so quite a difference to what we see today so those suppliers you'll see from the the screen will be required in some cases to have an SME ecosystem with them so that will be in the lot where we are not specifically targeting smes so in Lots 2B and 4B we're giving smes the opportunities to bid there and to try to remove the barriers to entry and as a consequence of that they won't be required to bring an SME ecosystem with them because"}
{"timestamp":"00:15:04","text":"that's quite an overhead for an SME anyway to front that for other smes in the lots that aren't specifically targeted at smes there will be some requirements there but we're going to make some changes to what was done within tsp so in tsp we had a requirement of a pass-through of at least 30 percent of revenues to an ecosystem of at least five suppliers in most of the cases what we're going to do in Dallas because we've got the equator SME consideration with those lots is reduce the revenue pass through to 20 to a minimum of three smes so that's perhaps a little bit more different and a little bit more attractive perhaps to some of the bidders the annual values that you see quoted that's a forecast value roughly based on our spend today so it's not a Target and it's not a commitment as such so we just need to position that correctly but that's what we anticipate spending each year over the course of the framework and the total value we've calculated over five years because as with all Frameworks there are certain contracts that you can let up to seven years be on"}
{"timestamp":"00:16:08","text":"the expiry of the framework so we're anticipating from a total value point of view that hmrcs spend alone will be in the order of about two billion pounds over the next five years now huge numbers as you can imagine and as Lee said huge pie to be able to go around a number of suppliers that will exist within this framework but thinking about it more broadly and Mike touched on this before and Philip are on Wednesday indeed about the fact that this is a CCS framework the overall value you'll have seen in the pin that was released to the market is four and a half billion which enables access from other government departments to be able to use some of the mechanisms and methods that we'll be using as part of setting this framework up so do we have another slide I'm handing over now to Tom skalach who's going to it's a video message because he can't be here in person today but I hope you'll enjoy this presentation"}

{"timestamp":"02:05:46","text":"co-durance here I was just wondering more about the one-to-one sessions in Birmingham just wondering like how long are they and do suppliers that have made the effort to come and see you in Birmingham get more points or yeah just wondering how it works can I just follow on because we have a couple questions online related so you can take them all together so where there's a question about whether there's an agenda for the face-to-face and whether the market engagement days are multi-supplier or individual supplier meetings so if you could take those so the events will be individual one-to-one so each supplier will individually be able to meet with a joint team from ccs and hmrc during those Market engagement sessions there will be no points allocated to attending face-to-face I think we would struggle to get that one past the lawyers but the the opportunity that there will be no agenda because it's an opportunity for you as suppliers to have digested everything that you've heard today reviewed the packs and come to us with any further questions that you"}
{"timestamp":"02:06:47","text":"might have one of the things that we found throughout tsp is that some of these events have been naturally limited I guess in the questions that have been asked and sometimes that's just about a bit of uncertainty as to how far to go with a question when you've got competitor organizations in the room with you so having the opportunity to ask that in an anonymized setting where nobody knows who's asked what question when it gets published we anticipated would give us greater opportunity to have more open dialogue in terms of the timing we're planning to allocate 45 minutes to each supplier for those face-to-face sessions does that cover all of the aspects of I think so I great all right let's see how are you thinking about content expertise versus Raw DDOT skills as you award lots for example Customs borders requires specialist knowledge to build good services"}
{"timestamp":"02:07:51","text":"I guess that's probably one more for Jillian and Dean to perhaps take between them foreign yeah someone can help with that so we need people who understand the technologies that we're building in we need people with the skills for example and obviously is sort of Bas and that sort of thing and Technical Architects the Customs knowledge because there are two sorts of technicals in our world the Customs knowledge comes from our selves so we have a a pool what we call it a large pool but a pool of subject matter experts we have a depth of knowledge inside cdio borders and trade so this is what I really mean by it's that combination of internals and externals you know at the end of it I mean partners that we work with become subject matter experts in that narrow field but we wouldn't expect you to come with deep knowledge of CPC code 2783 for"}

{"timestamp":"02:13:08","text":"to adopt in relation to that yes it would be a call of specific and how they want to apply it or if they want to apply it it's not going to be dictated across the framework this could be a key principle of the call up that hmrc are using and just to look back around on that question about the framework because obviously there's some uncertainty there we're running this as a restricted process specifically because we wanted to release this in waves because if we release the entire thing to the markets at once it will diminish the quality of what we are able to get back from the market so so consequently rather than having to those who might be interested in applying to be on five Lots at once you wouldn't want to stretch your A-Team so thinly in such a short space of time but what that also enables us to do is to release the specific elements of that wave at the time of the wave now when the it the first ITT goes out we will have details that cover the"}
