Sorry, I hear that thing I've said all of that. All right, thanks. Yeah, thank you very much and thank you for hosting this Market Engagement Event. Welcome everyone to this event. We're really delighted to have you here. It's great to see that CCS (Crown Commercial Service) and HMRC are collaborating on such an important activity, not just for HMRC but for the whole of government. Legacy migration, Legacy encapsulation, Legacy remediation is quite topical right now. Most of what we spend in government, you know, goes to managing our Legacy estate. So, it's really good to see us working collaboratively with HMRC to do this.","topic":"Legacy Migration","tags":["Legacy","Migration","HMRC","CCS","Government"],"sentiment":0.7,"urgency":0.5,"descriptive_normative":0.3,"questioning":0.2}

Dallas will offer an easy approach to assist in the provision of more cost effective and innovative solutions, again not just for HMR see but for the whole of government. So, my team and the team at the HMRC are looking forward to hearing from you all on this approach and on how we can ensure the success of yet another CCS agreement.

It's still a still a bit of a novelty as they're seeing everybody back face to face and it is it's absolutely great to see so thank you very much for that. And I'm going to give an introduction to why why we're doing this, why is HMRC with our friends in CTS building this framework and what's the purpose? So this is really the vehicle for the next stage in the technology sourcing program TSP.

{"timestamp":201,"text":"HMRC has been outsourced for a long time and a lot of the knowledge has sat with third-party suppliers. TSP is all about bringing the brain back in and so far, what have we done? We've done the disaggregation of the contracts, but that's very much the start of TSP. It is not what TSP is about. So, the disaggregation so far has been taking those big monolithic outsourced contracts and breaking them up into smaller contracts. But what we've done is we've taken one of Monopoly contracts and we've broken them down into much smaller Monopoly contracts. And we've done that for a couple of reasons: the maturity of HMRC didn't enable us to go from where we were to where we want to be in one jump, and also we had time constraints to get us to where we needed to be. So, Dallas is going to provide us that next level of contract vehicle to get the maturity of HMRC to help build that intelligent client to help us take the next step.","topic":"Outsourcing Knowledge","tags":["HMRC","TSP","Monopoly","Disaggregation","Dallas"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.7,"descriptive_normative":0.3,"questioning":0.2}
{"timestamp":267,"text":"Applications and our services to the next level, so there's three main aims of Dallas: they all begin with C, which makes it nice and easy to remember - capability, capacity, and competition. What Dallas aims to do is down select a smaller group of suppliers who will have the confidence that they are going to get significant work from HMRC, so they are able to invest in HMRC, really getting to know HMRC and provide the best quality of service to HMRC. Having multiple providers though gives us the best capacity. I don't think I've ever known such squeeze on capacity as we have right now, so relying on two smaller number of suppliers puts it at risk, and I think we've just seen across lots of areas over the last 12-24 months how important diversity in the supply chain is, and this will help us with that as well. Finally, competition.","topic":"Supply Chain","tags":["HMRC","Capacity","Competition","Diversity","Investment"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}
{"timestamp":334,"text":"A small number of suppliers that are pre-down selected means that we can keep competition, which helps drive value for money. Or, we can also do it quicker. So, instead of having to run procurements that take months through the Dallas framework, we should be able to turn things around in a matter of weeks. These are the three main drivers. You'll get some more detail today and this is the first of a whole string of market engagement. We really do want to hear your thoughts as well. At the end of it, we've got some questions, but we also have follow-up sessions. I'm now going to hand over to Mike. Thank you, Lee. Good morning, all. My name is Mike Hannan. I'm the category lead within CCS for technology services, cyber and technology transport, and my team will be looking after the Dallas framework and making sure that goes live.

And, clearly this is we've been talking to other government departments as well and they are looking to do something very similar to this. So, we're trying to build this so it's a capability that's available for all government departments. Okay, so as Lee said, we're trying to look at the rationalize the number of suppliers across each of the lots to ensure that we got the right suppliers in there, the right competition, the right capabilities to align those.

I'm going to head over to Phil now to just go into what the next aspects looks like in terms of what they think the value is going through the framework at this level for HMRC. Good morning, I'm Phil Desbrie, associate director for IT Commercial. My particular focus is as the commercial lead for HMRC for the Dallas project, delivering that alongside our colleagues in CCS. If we can move on to the next slide, you'll see an expanded view here of the last instructor that Mike's already shown you.

{"timestamp":661,"text":"So, in the digital space, for example digital development, we had a situation where we had a very small number of suppliers who had to be assigned to do one particular piece of activity, so we didn't have ongoing competitive tension and we struggled to adopt the GDs approach to Rainbow teams, where you would have individuals from multiple suppliers working together to deliver the same types of things. And when we have been able to do that with an HMRC, what that's tended to mean is that you've had an HMRC person looking after that Rainbow team and therefore the risk for delivery all stays with HMRC rather than being transferred into the market. So, we started off with that as a strategic problem and then started to build around this as to what the loss instructor should look like. So, as Mike's already pointed out, we have some large-scale suppliers operating in the digital space today. What we want to do is bolster that capability by bringing in opportunities for smaller suppliers, SMEs of course, but...","topic":"Digital Development","tags":["Digital","HMRC","Rainbow Teams","Suppliers","SMEs"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}

Lot 3, which will also be delivered as part of the first wave of competition activity as Mike said, is largely based on the Legacy run services that exist today. So, you will already know from TSP, we've competed things like Corporation Tax, we've competed things like Child Benefit services and Real-Time Information. Those services are going to be ultimately within that Lot, but you'll also see services that currently exist in Borders and Trade in that Lot. The services that we have retained with some incumbent suppliers that cover things like Self-Assessment, that cover PAYE, that cover Banking services, over time they will start to exit those contracts and will also drop into this framework as a means of procuring those.","topic":"Procurement Framework","tags":["Suppliers","Lots","Legacy","TSP","Corporation Tax","Child Benefit","Real-Time Information","Borders","Trade","Self-Assessment","PAYE","Banking"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.7,"descriptive_normative":0.3,"questioning":0.2}
{"timestamp":785,"text":"Services, and when you think about the number of suppliers that we've we've put here as our aspiration, that's very much focused on the point that Lee made about very rapid competition. So, what you can expect to see as we go through this process, and we'll describe it in a bit more detail later in the presentation, is to take steps to robustly pre-qualify the suppliers that we appoint on the basis of their capacity, their capability, their ability to work together with other suppliers. And the reason we need that is because when we have a trusted supplier group, we are then able to share much more information with that trusted supplier group. With the best will in the world, and for all of the wonderful things that CCS has done with their Frameworks, it's impossible for us to be able to share the level of information that we have with 150 suppliers on tech services three or three thousand suppliers on dos, if we have a smaller group of suppliers we can be much more open about our pipelines, we could be much more open about our architecture about our.","topic":"Supplier Qualification","tags":["Suppliers","CCS","Frameworks","Pipelines","Architecture"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}

There will be some requirements there, but we're going to make some changes to what was done within TSP. So, in TSP, we had a requirement of a pass-through of at least 30 percent of revenues to an ecosystem of at least five suppliers. In most of the cases, what we're going to do in Dallas, because we've got the Equator SME consideration with those lots, is reduce the revenue pass-through to 20 to a minimum of three SMEs. So, that's perhaps a little bit more different and a little bit more attractive perhaps to some of the bidders. The annual values that you see quoted, that's a forecast value roughly based on our spend today. So, it's not a target and it's not a commitment as such. We just need to position that correctly, but that's what we anticipate spending each year over the course of the framework and the total value we've calculated over five years, because as with all frameworks, there are certain contracts that you can let up to seven years be on.","topic":"SME Consideration","tags":["SME","Pass-Through","Revenues","Ecosystem","Suppliers"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}

The overall value you'll have seen in the PIN that was released to the market is four and a half billion, which enables access from other government departments to be able to use some of the mechanisms and methods that we'll be using as part of setting this framework up.

Two billion pounds is an overall forecast, is a big number to start us off with, but U.S. suppliers are only likely to be interested in investing to the extent that they are guaranteed to make some money from this. So, one of the options HMRC plans to include in Lots two and four is the option to direct award on what we're calling a tiered taxi rank basis. So, what we'll do is create three value levels and in those value levels the suppliers are pointed to that framework.

Why would we want to do that? Well, part of it is about transferring risk, but part of it is about giving us the opportunity to say okay, you've taken that risk, you've taken the extra King Shilling so to speak, so any issues that exists between yourselves and other suppliers within that group are your issues rather than ours.","topic":"Supplier Risk","tags":["Suppliers","Risk","Incentives","League Table","Government"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.7,"descriptive_normative":0.3,"questioning":0.8}

There will be no points allocated to attending face-to-face, but the opportunity that there will be no agenda because it's an opportunity for you as suppliers to have digested everything that you've heard today, reviewed the packs and come to us with any further questions that you've had.","topic":"Market Engagement","tags":["one-to-one","Birmingham","CCS","HMRC","Market Engagement"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.8}

So, having the opportunity to ask that in an anonymized setting, where nobody knows who's asked what question when it gets published, we anticipated would give us greater opportunity to have more open dialogue. In terms of the timing, we're planning to allocate 45 minutes to each supplier for those face-to-face sessions. Does that cover all of the aspects of I think so? I great. All right, let's see.

Now, some things are at this moment open to discussion as to how they land, and I think Michael will be able to say a little bit more on that. But so, when we land it, it'll be clear as to what information sits at the framework level, what sits within a department-specific service specification, and what sits within a call-off contract, potentially even an enduring call-off contract for the suppliers appointed, that we can then start to commission statements of work from.","topic":"Contract Framework","tags":["Public Service","Public Sector","Cabinet's Office","I.T Services","Michael"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.3,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}

We're running this as a restricted process specifically because we wanted to release this in waves, because if we release the entire thing to the markets at once it will diminish the quality of what we are able to get back from the market. So, consequently, rather than having those who might be interested in applying to be on five lots at once, you wouldn't want to stretch your A-Team so thinly in such a short space of time.

Those who participated in the processes that we followed under the Tech Sourcing Program and Tech Services Program will remember the steps that we took to level the playing field.

Also, the fact that we have framework Lots in which there are multiple opportunities to get onto the framework would in itself indicate that even if incumbent suppliers were to be successful throughout the process, it's not just going to be the incumbent suppliers who are going to be on the Lot, and it's certainly not just incumbent suppliers that will be allocated work through that Lot either on the taxi rank.","topic":"HMRC Suppliers","tags":["HMRC","Suppliers","Tech Sourcing Program","Tech Services Program","Framework Lots"],"sentiment":0.5,"urgency":0.2,"descriptive_normative":0.7,"questioning":0.2}

Because we just don't know what they are now, where we're procuring for a framework rather than for a contract.

So, where you might have a supplier that could perhaps create some kind of unconscious bias for one evaluator in one part of the business about wanting to keep them, that would absolutely be leveled off by the fact that there are multiple evaluators from multiple parts of the business you may have nothing to do with with that supplier.
