The cross-government aspect is consistent in terms of both the book level and the customer requirements. Jillian, Dean, or Rich might agree with this perspective. Phil also concurs, noting that the approach would depend on the project. If a project of a particular nature arises, suppliers would be given ample warning, although this is not the norm for the digital platform team. Sensitive data is usually involved in such cases. Jillian adds that while there are occasional instances involving secret data or elements, such as the risk of goods, these situations are handled with prior knowledge.

HMRC is very much on the clock with this because we're looking to try and get it in at a time roughly around the expiry of the initial terms of some existing contracts. That's what's driving some of those decisions. Broadly speaking, we're looking to down-select to double the number of suppliers that we intend to appoint to the framework. There may be one or two variations around that, particularly if you end up with a tie. For example, if the suppliers that are our 10th and 11th on the list score identically, then we would probably take them through on an identical score. Generally, we will set the level and cut off everything below that level. But broadly speaking, we're aiming for double the figures that you see on the screen there. Hi, Ed.

So, the disaggregation so far has been taking those big monolithic outsourced contracts and breaking them up into smaller contracts. But what we've done is we've taken one of the monopoly contracts, easy for me to say, and we've broken them down into much smaller monopoly contracts. We've done that for a couple of reasons. The maturity of HMRC didn't enable us to go from where we were to where we want to be in one jump. Also, we had time constraints to get us to where we needed to be.

So, where you might have a supplier that could perhaps create some kind of unconscious bias for one evaluator in one part of the business, that would absolutely be leveled off by the fact that there are multiple evaluators from multiple parts of the business who may have nothing to do with that supplier. In some ways, it's self-policing, but it's also moderated as well by the commercial team to ensure any traces of bias are removed from the process, however unconscious those traces of bias may be.","topic":"Bias Removal in Evaluations","tags":["bias removal","evaluation process","level playing field","unconscious bias","commercial team"],"sentiment":7,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":3,"questioning":1,"timestamp":589}

If an SME was to apply directly for the lots relevant for them, can they also still apply for the supply chain ones as well, as in going alongside with the big boys? Absolutely. There's also some advantage in that, I would suggest, because it enables greater opportunity to flex across different lots for some views possible. We're definitely keen to encourage that.

We just don't know what they are now. Where we're procuring for a framework rather than for a contract, and when we start to put in place call-offs, there will potentially be some of those call-offs where there are TUPE implications and transition cost implications. We will start to provide information on those on a case-by-case basis, but you could expect that it would follow the same sort of process that we've done in TSP, where transition cost wouldn't be taken into account as part of the scoring of the bid.

While we do have significant capability in the organization, we do need to build that further so that we can validate and test the things that we're being told by suppliers on an ongoing basis.

What we want to do over the course of the next three to eight years really is to move towards an estate where predominantly it is configurable platforms and products.

As has been mentioned, we don't want to close the book on the art of the possible if there's something that can genuinely help us proposition that we have here. Essentially, what we were thinking about is that in lot 2A and 4A, where we have larger suppliers, we would set a mechanism whereby if the profit margin that was generated from the framework exceeded 25%, then in bandings above 25%, it would be possible to remit a percentage of the excess profit above 25% into Innovation funds.

Two billion pounds is an overall forecast, which is a big number to start us off with.

One of the options HMRC plans to include in Lots two and four is the option to direct award on what we're calling a tiered taxi rank basis. So, what we'll do is create three value levels, and in those value levels, the suppliers appointed to that framework a lot will literally take turns getting work packages allocated to them up to a certain value level.

I'm not saying names, but what good would look like, if you see what I mean. Because I think that would be extremely useful, thank you. Interestingly, the I mentioned before about the work stream that we've just set up, and Rich may want to talk a little bit more about this in","topic":"Technology Presentation","tags":["technology","presentation","CCS website","prime suppliers","annual values"],"sentiment":6,"urgency":4,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":5,"timestamp":8107}
{"parsed":"I just want to take a little bit of time to say thank you, Lee. It looks like you're up to say thank you first. So, just to wrap up, I want to say thanks to Tech UK first of all for hosting and facilitating. Thank you to all of the speakers. I hope you found that informative. I've certainly learned some things about Dallas and HMRC from the last couple of hours. I hope you all did as well. Most of all, thank you to everyone attending, both the people that have come in today as well as those online. Thanks so much for the people answering those questions, showing a lot of interest. To be honest, we're wasting our time if we don't get a lot of interest in this framework. It's no good if suppliers don't want to be on it. You've seen the next steps. There is opportunity. We do not have the monopoly on good ideas. We have time between now and October to hear your thoughts and feedback. If you've got that, there are a number of channels to reach out. Please take advantage of those.","topic":"Event Closing Remarks","tags":["thank you","Tech UK","Dallas","HMRC","feedback"],"sentiment":8,"urgency":4,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":2,"timestamp":8168}
{"parsed":"Determining the best route to market from a strategic point of view for HMRC, it would make sense for us, wherever possible, to put as much work through the Dallas framework as possible. There's no loss to CCS from that either, because, being a CCS framework, it attracts the levy. So, whenever we spend through this, it becomes a virtuous circle for all of government in terms of spend under management. But as things start to move forward, you may start to see the other forays into the market that HMRC has made in things like data and SAP start to unify under this type of approach in future iterations too. Another one from online: Can HMRC facilitate introductions or contact sharing for larger primes and interested SMEs? Mike, do you want to take that? Yeah, so CCS has kindly volunteered to facilitate those arrangements.","topic":"HMRC Market Strategy","tags":["HMRC","Dallas framework","CCS","market strategy","SMEs"],"sentiment":7,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":3,"timestamp":8237}
{"parsed":"One thing we've been really happy to see is the response to our tech sourcing program competitions. It's abundantly clear that those organizations who view social value as being important for life, and not just for Christmas, stand out. When we observe ecosystems being established, and lead organizations working in a complementary way with their ecosystem partners to create opportunities in local communities, it's impressive. These partnerships help us understand how they will impact, design, define, and deliver throughout the lifecycle of a particular statement of work. We can start to see those organizations that truly want to have a social impact. The trickle-down of economics, both to the SME organizations and into those local communities, can have a real impact as a result of the things we do together, us in government and the suppliers.","topic":"Tech Sourcing Program Impact","tags":["social value","ecosystems","community impact","government partnerships","SME support"],"sentiment":8,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":0,"timestamp":8297}
{"parsed":"But clearly, price is important. Given the economic pressures that exist now, we understand that it's going to be a challenge when bids are put in to maintain the competitiveness of pricing for the headline rate cards that are produced. However, we will be looking to get the highest quality solutions to meet our needs at the best possible price, whilst recognizing that the cheapest isn't always the best. Great, I'll just pause for any final questions or comments from the room. No one? Bar left on the microphone, so okay, great. You have promised there are more questions on Slido that we haven't had time to address, but you guys will review those questions and provide the answers. So, rest assured that even if you didn't get to ask it or have it answered now, they will be answered and addressed.","topic":"Economic Pressures and Pricing Strategy","tags":["economic pressures","pricing strategy","quality solutions","competitiveness","customer engagement"],"sentiment":6,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":4,"timestamp":8358}
{"parsed":"That is important to us, and so, I think the openness that we're looking to develop in the partnership arrangements with the suppliers would necessitate a situation where we would have to have fairly robust conversations if suppliers were to bite off more than they could chew. Likewise, I think when we come to qualifying suppliers to be appointed to the Lots, we will be looking at financial standings to just determine whether or not they would be capable of, at the very least, meeting the type of minimum workshare commitments that we would be proposing for the lot. Thanks. I will take another question that came in online. There's a question about whether there will be any situation where you may still procure via other frameworks, such as DOS or G-Cloud. So, I think the quick answer to that is, we wouldn't want to constrain ourselves. So, whatever options are available, we'll do an analysis, a commercial analysis.","topic":"Supplier Partnership and Procurement","tags":["supplier partnership","procurement","financial standings","DOS","G-Cloud"],"sentiment":7,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":4,"timestamp":8421}
{"parsed":"Services, and when you think about the number of suppliers that we've put here as our aspiration, that's very much focused on the point that Lee made about very rapid competition. So, what you can expect to see as we go through this process, and we'll describe it in a bit more detail later in the presentation, is to take steps to robustly pre-qualify the suppliers that we appoint on the basis of their capacity, their capability, their ability to work together with other suppliers. The reason we need that is because when we have a trusted supplier group, we are then able to share much more information with that trusted supplier group. With the best will in the world, and for all of the wonderful things that CCS has done with their Frameworks, it's impossible for us to be able to share the level of information that we have with 150 suppliers on tech services, or three thousand suppliers on DOS. If we have a smaller group of suppliers, we can be much more open about our pipelines, we could be much more open about our architecture.","topic":"Supplier Pre-qualification","tags":["supplier management","pre-qualification","collaboration","information sharing","CCS Frameworks"],"sentiment":7,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":0,"timestamp":8483}
{"parsed":"At an individual level, we'd give a lot of notice about that. There's not a lot, there is some, but not a great deal. Thanks, Dean. I think I'll take a final question here. How much rating on prices will there be, and how will pricing be scored in ITT? So, to be finalized, we're still working on my level of detail, and we'll work out how what's the importance of pricing across the pieces and work out how we can get the best commercial value into the framework early on to help all of our customers get even better commercial value going forward. I mean, just to expand on the HMRC view on that, we certainly have a perspective that, as Lee set out at the beginning, the capacity, capability, and competition are more of the key features for us rather than price specifically.","topic":"Pricing in ITT Framework","tags":["pricing","ITT framework","commercial value","HMRC","competition"],"sentiment":5,"urgency":4,"descriptive_normative":3,"questioning":5,"timestamp":8545}
{"parsed":"\"Be able to apply with other Primes in the same lot, if that makes sense. Thanks.\" \"So, just to understand the question then, if there are five primes in lot 2A, could we join or apply with several primes within the same lot?\" \"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, obviously, there will be conversations and discussions that you will enter into with those primes about the nature of the working agreement that would exist between you. But we would want to place no constraint on any supply chain members from operating with multiple suppliers across those lots. So, I suppose technically, you could end up as a supplier for five of the lead suppliers within one of the lots and also as a direct supplier in the B part of the lot, which for SMEs might maximize your opportunity to generate business. But obviously, we've talked a lot about capacity, we've talked a lot about capability.\"","topic":"Supply Chain Collaboration","tags":["supply chain","collaboration","SMEs","business opportunity","capacity"],"sentiment":8,"urgency":5,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":3,"timestamp":8606}
{"parsed":"That's quite an overhead for an SME. Anyway, to front that for other SMEs in the lots that aren't specifically targeted at SMEs, there will be some requirements there. But we're going to make some changes to what was done within TSP. So, in TSP, we had a requirement of a pass-through of at least 30 percent of revenues to an ecosystem of at least five suppliers. In most of the cases, what we're going to do in Dallas, because we've got the Equator SME consideration with those lots, is reduce the revenue pass-through to 20 to a minimum of three SMEs. So, that's perhaps a little bit more different and a little bit more attractive perhaps to some of the bidders. The annual values that you see quoted, that's a forecast value roughly based on our spend today. So, it's not a target and it's not a commitment as such. So, we just need to position that correctly. But that's what we anticipate spending each year over the course of the framework. And the total value we've calculated over five years, because as with all frameworks, there are certain contracts that you can let up to seven years beyond.","topic":"SME Revenue Pass-Through Changes","tags":["SME","revenue pass-through","TSP","Dallas","framework"],"sentiment":5,"urgency":6,"descriptive_normative":2,"questioning":0,"timestamp":8672}
